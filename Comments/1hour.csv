"75% of calls end up worthless you say?  That's interesting   Perhaps GME is a bad example because of it's crazy ups and downs I wonder how much that % is skewed because people think ""I'm going to buy a crazy long shot 4/12 800c or how often that type of long shot buy happens on other stocks",2021-03-16 02:05:33.868175

It’s still outperformed the SP500 since it’s IPO  Was over 300$ prior to the regulation talks  Fair value of the stock is roughly 350$  Only reason it’s not and PDD and JD went so high since covid was due to the regulation threats  Earnings were amazing and when this blows over its going back to over 300$ as investors try to find fair value in a sea of overvalued tech stocks  This is my opinion  There is a risk of Chinese government breaking BaBa which is why the stock is trading so far below it’s fair value ,2021-03-16 02:06:16.473842

Ironically this is a lesson video games taught me  Specifically Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim  While acting as a monarch I collected taxes and took a cut from all sales in the kingdom  So the way I saw it any money I gave the heroes or spent on the town would always come back to me  Therefor it was best to have as much of it as possible in the hands of the people making me more money and spending it  All their money is my money eventually so they needed as much as possible  It kept everything working as best as possible everybody had all the best armor and weapons and healing potions they could afford they looted the best dungeons and eventually all that gold wound up in my pocket   I got really high today and forgot what I was talking about but I'm now apparently installing Majesty so that's what I'm doing tonight ,2021-03-16 02:06:18.728156

Quick follow-up then can you submit that kind of multi-pronged approach as a single transaction through your broker or do you have to go through the whole buy/sell process all four times?

Covered calls are different  You could sell a call for this Friday covered since you own 100 shares at 12 5 for $37  You keep the $37 and as long as BB stays under 12 5 you get to keep your shares too  If you are worried about a price rise you can sell $13 call for $27  Again you keep the $27 and as long as BB stays under $13 you keep your shares  Even if it hits the call amount you still get money since they buy those shares from you ,2021-03-16 02:07:52.604197

You could put forward candidates for the board for the shareholders to vote on at the next annual meeting    I imagine I would be just as qualified as any of the gme board members not Cohen though since the majority of corporate board members literally don't do anything but approve M&A replace retiring or terrible CEOs and approve executive pay packages   If enough people signalled intent to vote for new board members and remove some of the existing ones then perhaps they would feel enough heat to act   I think it would be absurd to suggest individual investors can't coordinate nominating board members but institutions and billionaires can takeover boards  Instutions like Morgan Stanley are literally a collection of thousands of individual 'investors' through their 401ks and funds that use a proxy advisor to coordinate strategy and gain economies of scale/specialization    Replacing a board or crony CEO via collective action of individual shareholders doesn't seem like market manipulation to me  But I'm not a lawyer ,2021-03-16 02:08:12.533165

Your not looking at the full picture though  It depends when he sold the calls and bought the shares  If I own 100 shares of a stock trading at $20 00 and sell a $10 the call price should be the intrinsic value $20-$10 plus the premium  If the stock trades sideways until expiration My shares get called away and I’m just left with the premium I earned  If it goes down below $10 the option expires worthless but the value of my shares are also cut in half but since I collected that intrinsic value at the option sale I’m basically in the same position   There’s nothing dangerous about this   it’s dumb but not risky,2021-03-16 02:08:26.012971

How is this DD?,2021-03-16 02:11:37.275532
Here's an example of why this options play might not work:  Let's say you buy a $125 call expiring this Friday because it has a delta of about 0 90  The cost of this contract is a fat $10220  At the same time someone is buying a $125 put also expiring this Friday  This contract costs $718 altogether   In order to hedge gamma and vega of both the call and the put the market maker can just buy a $195 call for $5305  The remaining delta to be hedged is under 15 shares which can be bought for $3252  The market maker gets to keep $2381 from these exchanges which is a much nicer than buying 90 shares on the market   Meanwhile with that $10220 you spent you could have bought 48 shares outright and have something that lasts longer than 4 days ,2021-03-16 02:11:37.861812

How they choose to gamble shouldn't affect you  You're getting too hive minded when you are telling people what to do with their money if not it makes you mad because you have no desired results immediately    Ask yourself what is your plan? What does your research say you should do? Cause this shit can and will go sideways    At this point this is a game of psychology and money with an upside of GME becoming a powerhouse  When you own shares nobody can push you around  You sell when you want to sell  Options on the other hand that's true gambling   Are you calculated and patient? Stocks  Are you impulsive and want to make or lose money fast? Options  See the post from last week  Dude bought 90k worth of options and lost it all ,2021-03-16 02:12:05.996880

Great points  This entire weekend was one big preemptive victory lap in hindsight this should've been a red flag  I don't think I've *ever* seen a Monday opening go well after an entire weekend is spent publicly jerking each other off about the guaranteed money we'll all be making during the week   In general I think the good deed trend is great  It's a nice way of counteracting the absurd media coverage about the situation and I think it's refreshing to see people coming in to money and first thinking to do kind things for others  I think the general perception is WSB/GME is a bunch of school shooters YOLOing their parents bank accounts  I think if people could see that this is more than a feud over a stocks value they'd be far more understanding and perhaps interested in hopping on board   That said yes     all the gorilla money would've probably done more good in the market this morning  It's not like we really need PR I just see it as a once in a lifetime opportunity to show people that hoarding ungodly amounts of wealth is *not* virtuous   Thanks to the hedgehogs of the world income/wealth inequality are on a trajectory to be the death of modern society   TLDR: Good deeds are great but perhaps we should do them from the moon,2021-03-16 02:12:13.212256

True but no where near the increase of GME  When you compaired them AMC is kinda shitty by normal conditions it's a solid hype play but we're not in normal conditions and GME is a raging bull ready to fuck the 🌈🐻 AMC just a bull chilling    My point is there will never be a play like GME ever agian and the constant suggestion that AMC is similar is neglecting the reality GME is primed for a bull run based on their pivot to E-commerce alone with the squeeze being a big fat juicy cherry on top  AMC is literally just opening up to losing less money they haven't changed their business model at all the only real bull thesis for anything above $30 a share is hype and the possibility of a small squeeze doing something beacuse all shorts can easily cover in less than a day and AMC is fully ready to release more shares to cushion their bottom line after losing their ass during the pandemic    If AMC has a plan to change business models and were taking steps to do it that would be another story but they're just returning to the previous status quo with less capacity ,2021-03-16 02:12:17.539411

If you want a forced cover price has to go high enough to liquidate aka Margin Call  Other then that it is a choice cover  But it costs them collateral tied up interest and fines and risk of lawsuits based on FTDs   Also the DTCC rule could all of the sudden force mass coverings to avoid posting collateral  Where as right now they can clean their position report then re-enter the position and be good for another 30 days  If the DTCC can look daily and go “awe fuck your over leveraged post capital or we start selling”   Our brokerages look at our accounts daily to make sure we are not overexposing them to losses  The DTCC should look at institutions daily  This alone lets you know that the system was rigged to favor wealthy   You will find stories all over the place of an average pleb getting margin called and the stock bounced the next day  Imagine if you could sit in a Margin Call for a month and had unlimited access to the most sophisticated financial and leverage tactics  It becomes hard to loose,2021-03-16 02:13:00.719503

They wouldn't print money cuz of the squeeze im just sayin that money isn't finite if they can just keep printing more and more  It just devalues the national currency as a whole and costs of goods will go up  As I said before the 19th is when the new rule takes effect and usually when you get margin called they allow 2-5 days to meet the demands ,2021-03-16 02:13:34.138984

Because the tomato meter is a wierd ass metric it's a measure of a measure so if you thought it was a 51%+ movie that's a positive review if you thought it was 49%- movie that'd a negative review and the tomato meter is x-positive reviews /total    Hence if a movie is at 70% that means 7/10 people thought it was a decent movie   So this movie could be a 49% review average movie but 0 on the tomato meter,2021-03-16 02:13:44.252380

Yeah I think that's the stat 75% of all options  You have to consider that the vast majority of options are sold by your market maker TD E-Trade whatever  They make good money selling theta  So they are definitely rigged against you   Gme is crazy volatile but that's compensated for in the IV so those options are rediculous expensive for what they are  But the long shot buying happens with all stocks but a long shot on gme is different than a long shot on say apple or something   And that is compensated based on the crazy premiums on gme vs  apple ,2021-03-16 02:14:07.022693

Again I ask with what money? Going $100000 in debt doesn't sound great  Then I can spend the rest of my life paying it off  That's just a different person getting rich off my labor  Also thanks for exemplifying why blue collar workers are so looked down upon in this country  Oddly enough it's that attitude that has dissuaded enough people from learning a trade that what I do is getting rarer by the year and makes my labor even more valuable ,2021-03-16 02:14:14.188334

It's called selling to close the contract  Just like the stock these contracts get bought and sold all day long  If you buy to open today you can sell to close at any time but that value will swing harder and faster than the stock  Which is why options are both awesome and risky ,2021-03-16 02:15:26.050819

Here's my tin hat DD     In my humble opinion There's 2 fucking stonks right now  How can that be so confusing   If average Joe missed Gme and doesn't have X $200+ buy in he will will gravitate to AMC because it's cheaper and when GME goes brr the fallout will be AMC most likely raising with it   Apes know that so hedges must know that also   But first GME has to raise if you're an ape   If AMC goes first while GME dips there will be less financial support and I think this is why if I was shorting I would make sure GME stays low while AMC has it's moment and starves out from lack of GME tendies financial support   If people keep their money/Shares 💎🙌 in gme and there's no tendies to cash in that a lot of money not in AMC so that's good for hedges   Now if people take their money from gme and jump to AMC they can tank AMC and they just wrecked both and made wsb lose a lot of money in the correct order ,2021-03-16 02:15:26.150298

"If the hedge funds were not in danger there would be no need for widespread bot FUD  There would be no need for the private message I got this morning telling me to sell my GME and put it into a certain weed stock  There would be no need for news agencies- which are owned by/tied to/receive money from said hedge funds- to post article after article about what a terrible investment GME is  Especially articles that magically reflect a big dip in the price before the dip even occurs  There would be no need for shill bots to look for ticker symbols to hype $ASS $SSR etc  Notice how those bots stopped once people caught on?   ALL of these things are happening and more  Every day  There are dozens of posts about it  Hundreds of reports of it occurring   If the hedge funds were in the clear- if they truly had no reason to worry- then none of this would be happening   If you can interpret subtext even a little bit it's very clear that buy and hodl are the moves here   The only conceivable thing I could think of for why the hedge funds might do the above even if they were totally in the clear would be to profit off of cycles of FOMO and shorting  It's technically possible  However my money is literally on them being in way wayyyy over their heads right about now   Three months from now I think there will be two kinds of posts around WSB and related subs: massive massive gain porn and ""I shoulda held"" stories ",2021-03-16 02:16:40.010815

Yeah probably especially because they’re running low on funds  They suspended the debt ceiling at the end of 2019 before all this popped off  They have to reevaluate whether or not to reinstall the debt ceiling or not  Democrats are calling to remove the debt ceiling permanently which is literally the most brain dead shit I’ve ever heard of  They’ll try and get rid of the filibuster to pull it off but i don’t even think they’ll be able to get every democrat on board  If it’s reinstated that means the federal reserve will have to figure out how to magically remove trillions in debt because they’ll have to be under the 2019 debt ceiling or else the federal reserve will have committed a federal crime  They’ll probs just gradually lower it back down every year but we’ll see  I think Powell is starting to get a little anxious about his past spending sprees ,2021-03-16 02:17:37.415643

Yeah but those premiums are insane and make up for the difference  We don't know his sell price though since he's screen capping the current price  If he sold those calls today that's almost 150k in premium  If he sold them a few days ago? More than that  Cost basis of 163  Seems like he's not super fucked   If GME tanks he still has the premium  But he's now in the hole on his shares  But he also still has the shares to keep selling cc on  Both of ya'll kind of wrong ,2021-03-16 02:18:45.829386

It’s not that negative  People are making assumptions without even watching it    I was expecting way worse but I thought it was pretty factual and very neutral  Almost every person interviewed was rooting for retail investors and they mentioned the connection between RH and Citadel  Some people have made posts saying it looked fishy because people interviewed had all new houses    that’s not true at all 🤣  There were a couple of Reddit users that clearly weren’t in some set up home    People are also bitching because they claim it ended the story on GME’s lowest prices  But that’s also not true  At the end of it it addresses that the price soared again on 3/8 and this story isn’t over    I’m definitely someone who doesn’t trust the media and I question the intentions of shows like this  But I’ve been on this sub for the whole ride and I didn’t think it was that bad  JMHO,2021-03-16 02:20:01.038736

"Maybe I'm blowing things up but I feel like I should address this since you're not the only one with these concerns:  1  I don't really like how everything I say gets overanalyzed  I don't remember exactly when I said that but it's entirely possible I was tired joking or just plain frustrated  At times my actions toe the line of what acceptable when you take hundreds of mod actions a day it's inevitable  Every decision I make ends up with at least one unhappy party  Understandably I get roasted for when I cross the line and that's completely fair  But bringing it up many weeks later is a real bummer and makes me think twice before doing something fun like posting that cat megathread lest it be considered ""a distraction""  This isn't directed at you just people in general  2  The whole team was exhausted from being attacked from both sides  GME cultists / new users who saw WSB as a pumping ground and anything non-WSB as treason and old and ""old"" users who were frustrated with the complete excess of GME content on the sub   Not to mention we had a whole host of other problems like trying to reinvent the mod bots / automod working with admins avoiding media slander defending against people stealing our name / logo and avoiding anything that could remotely be construed as illegal or unethical   In all honesty when GME fell in Jan/Feb I was relieved  We were all running on empty and it was brutal waking up to hundreds or thousands of hate messages every day    Did we do everything right? Heck no  We weren't even close to optimal  There's a lot of things we -- I did that could have gone better  But given the circumstances I'm proud of how we handled it and know we can handle the future even better ",2021-03-16 02:22:42.747885

Ahh yes but it does if the company is heavily undervalued    Nobody retail investors that is wants to invest in a fucking mortgage company  They want to invest in exciting things like electric cars retail and integrated software ecosystems  Mortgages aren’t sexy  Hedge funds are betting that people loose interest on an IPO after it shoots up   Remember the market isn’t rational anymore  Fundamentals don’t really matter  Well at least until you have 8 straight quarters of better than expected earnings  Only then they can’t ignore it  But until then and since shorts have no expiration date they are going to short the shit out of RKT for the next three quarters thinking it’s going to go down because it’s a boring ass mortgage company ,2021-03-16 02:23:32.965566
Yes he sold calls   If they get exercised he gets the money   In can't actually see his positions because my reddit app won't open the link but let's consider a deep ITM covered call example   Say the stock price is $250   Say that the premium on $200 calls is $80   So he buys 100 shares $25k and sells 1 $200 call he collects $8k   So he is in for a total of $17k   If the options get exercised he loses the shares but he collects the strike $20k   So he is into the position for $17k and he is out for $20k   Net profit = $3000   On the other hand if the stock tanks to $150 then his shares don't get called away but his 100 shares are only worth $15k   So he is down $2000   This is a bullish though heavily hedged position   His max profit happens when the stock stays above the strike  His break-even happens when the stock is at $170   If it goes below $170 he loses money ,2021-03-16 02:23:32.966146

Do you find joy in blatantly lying or something? Lmao  It reached $387 on Jan 1  It’s currently at $330 despite consistently showing impressive earnings  It’s currently undervalued by any metric  It’s a non-risky value play  Is it going to make you rich overnight? No  Is it going to make you money? Yes ,2021-03-16 02:25:10.883289

The share price is so detached from fundamentals right now that an earnings beat won't move the needle much at all    People are straight up delusional if they think GME is a long term value play at current prices or that $1k - $2k per share is a reasonable target in 3 years time  At $2k per share GME would have a market cap of $150 billion for goodness sake  Walmart has a market cap of $370B  Do people really think a bricks and mortar video game retailer is worth that much?,2021-03-16 02:25:32.073847

IV  Was nearly zero  When I had checked it a few days ago it was like 3% IV which is unheard of  ITM Contracts were selling for $ 01  The SLR suspension lead to big banks buying up trillions in treasuries  If it’s not extended they’ll potentially offload all of it at once because if they do it gradually they’ll be selling it at a cheaper price and losing more money  The people who sold puts will have to cover for when it’s exercised so they’ll either have to liquidate their other assets if they sold naked or they’ll have to sell off their underlying if they’re covered because it’ll be worse less the more it goes down  Gamma squeezes are also possible in the downwards direction  If they sold naked and have to sell off their other assets the indices will tank causing others to sell off their assets which will include a lot of bonds  $10000 worth of puts at the time i had posted this would’ve been 10000 already ITM put contracts  Which is the equivalent of 1000000 20 year treasuries  If you wanted to you could go use a put profit calculator and edit the contract price and put 10000 contracts and see what i mean ,2021-03-16 02:25:57.921617

The people in the derivatives market knew exactly what was happening but nothing was illegal and all the institutions thought they wouldn't be caught holding the bag but it wasn't until a bank in NYC got called on their debt realized they had subprime worthless dogshit in their portfolio and the FED chair got involved at Dubya's request   Real fucking talk that bank stimulus probably prevented great depression 2 electric boogaloo which blows shit because the management for all those banks should've been in prison instead of riding a golden parachute out of their CSuite  &#x200B;  The banks had to show their books everyone realized they were upside down on a shitload of mortgages and two banks dissolved immediately to cover small amounts of the problem  Nothing they did was illegal so no one was punished despite the absolute fucking fallout that crushed the American economy   &#x200B;  Don't expect Melvin to walk away from this the same way but I doubt they'll let it happen without all sorts of shady shit ,2021-03-16 02:26:22.280930

Question for people on fidelity    how do they handle option spreads on the day of expiration?    Robinhood closes out all spreads on positions with any kind of volatility unless both legs are at least 5% ITM  And when they close them out they issue a market buy/sell order which is almost always filled well below/above the mark    they don’t even try a limit order at or near the mark  If you have limit orders to close pending they’ll cancel them    For example the past two Fridays I had TSLA spreads with both legs ITM by more than $20  Both times Robinhood closed them for 1/2 the mark average    both times for almost exactly 40% of the spread value   Not only were all my gains lost by they closed them for less than I opened them even though I opened them when they weren’t yet ITM     My $2 50 spreads were closed for $1 11 and my $5 spreads were closed for $2 31    A week’s worth of gains wiped out plus a 15% loss on the original investment    for ITM spreads one hour before expiration!  I wonder which RH employee got to buy them from me without me having any say in the matter     60% lost in three minutes due to Robinhood’s bullshit    The immediate vertical drop on my chart was eye boggling when I opened it   It looked just like GME did on Wednesday    That was a $10000 mistake I won’t make again  I thought the first time was a fluke but the second time showed it’s deliberate   Fucking theft ,2021-03-16 02:29:25.022764

Hmm I’m not an accountant so would need one to chime in here or anyone smarter than me really  Business deductions have to be very specific to the field they operate in so not sure that’s applicable here  But the capital loss short or long just go in your schedule D  And then gets tacked on to your standard or itemized deductions ,2021-03-16 02:29:26.649021
All right I’ll fess up  I bought 50 shares when DFV told the Congress it was a good play at $40  Then it shot up out of no where so I sold at $180  I’ve been watching ever since  Could I have made more?

My dude what? Taxation has all sorts of uses even beyond a source of revenue which you’re right we clearly don’t need  Taxation helps to prevent the overstimulation of the economy  Send checks to every American? That is great  It will go straight to consumption in almost every case  But it is possible you could suddenly have too much money chasing too few goods so how do you fix that? You could raise interest rates and scare the shit out of the market  You could force people to save with forced bonds like during WW2  Or    you could tax people who make over $400000 a year so that middle and lower class Americans don’t feel the burden of both the potential inflation and the taxation that could help stymy it ,2021-03-16 02:30:52.453026

So the next budget reconciliation will happen in October and a bi-partisan infrastructure bill will never see the light of day because of GOP Senate obstructionism  So at least we have a solid timeline for the next fiscal juice  Because of the nature of budget reconciliation the two moderate Dems Manchin and Collins have the BR process by the balls and so we’ve seen the stimulus grand totals wane due to these two Senator’s inane sense of fiscal responsibility  Markets expect that to continue and the next undoubtably infrastructure-centered fiscal policy to reflect that trend   But here’s the catch—what if Manchin and Collins play ball for infrastructure? What if it’s a $2T or much much more package that blows away expectations?   Infrastructure and energy has been ripping during this Biden administration in expectation of infrastructure investment but prices don’t reflect a BR that wildly defies current lowered expectations  And there lies an opportunity ,2021-03-16 02:32:14.263525

They needed to buy back more shares than exist  At 140% shorted they needed to buy almost 100 million shares and as they did the price was going to reach thousands of dollars per share  The market cap would have blown up well past 16b as the shares went skyrocketing   It would have eclipsed the rest of the market however briefly and tanked everything because they *repeatedly* engaged in a strategy of infinite risk  They violated the rules of the free market to avoid detonating the bomb they created from over-shorting ,2021-03-16 02:35:32.912673

The theory is basically that the HFs would bankrupt then the DTCC would use its insurance to foot the bill and the Fed would print the money to back it  Which assumes that people who lie and cheat daily for a living would just HAVE TO pay  It’s all predicated on the US wanting so badly to preserve the purity of its free market that it will just take the world’s biggest L  Obvious to me that the powers that be would rather just cheat say that we are economic terrorists or some BS and most of the finance world will welcome it  Because the alternative is catastrophic for them  Then they can adjust rules to prevent it happening again   We don’t even have close to a free market  Mortgage bailouts QE etc are already huge violations of that “purity” and guess what people still do business in the US ,2021-03-16 02:35:33.520175

The problem with only buying options is that they can just run down the price with shorting   If you buy shares it takes the shares out of the pool forever and even if we miss this gamma squeeze shorts are permanently in a weaker position   Shouldn't the goal just be buy as many shares as possible?  If that's the case then waiting for them to try tank and buying back is the most capital efficient strategy to grab up shares ,2021-03-16 02:36:49.897059

No matter how much money they lose there is one guarantee they are betting on  GME will crash to double digits again  So they have to just keep taking out short positions and wait for the pump to end ant the will make WAY more money on the free fall than they ever lost in the 1st place  It's a win/win for smart money  There is no short squeeze  It's over anyone who says different is trying to get u to bag hold  This is just a classic pump and dump now ,2021-03-16 02:37:51.996044

Yeah they just trying to get people to move to amc  Amc is nothing compared to GME  It’s for people who like the idea of having more shares of something rather than people who like the percentage of their money to be gained  HF thought of a good strategy to pump one while draining the other  Im sure it worked a little but it will end soon ,2021-03-16 02:42:21.603684

In round one I will admit I was in it to make a profit   I did   Then I learned why it happened and to be honest it pissed me off   I like Gamestop and AMC   Always have   For a HF or HFs to target these companies and try to destroy them in order to further line their pockets doesn't work with me   Retail investors have them by the juublies and those HF bastards will do all they can to avoid handing bananas over to the Retail investors   We are beating the HFs at their own game   Its no longer about personal profit   This is about biting out their livers with my teeth and spitting it out at their feet while they watch in horror    and then moving on to their buddies and doing the same thing     Once I learned how HFs make their living and what they intended to do to my beloved childhood friends GME and AMC the gloves are off   I fully intend to ride these shares to the end wherever and whenever that arrives   If they want to do ladder attacks to reduce the price GREAT!  I will do just what I have been doing buy more and more and more    I am no expert but borrowing 600M 45 days or so after coughing up 2 8B for those idiots at Melvin doesn't instill confidence in Citadel's cash flow situation  I don't want to bleed them to death   I want to rip out each major artery one by one until they are so utterly devoid of blood not even one more drop can be squeezed from them with a steamroller   Don't attack my childhood friends!

I could see infinitismals before/after the first/last place value with a digit expressing something larger than zero/nothing yet for digits that the zero is stating there are no numerals in that place a zero makes sense  IE 105 essentially if you were to decompose the number it is the same as saying ten tens and five ones or /one/ hundred /zero/ tens and /five/ ones so the zero is important to note that there is an a sense of a numeral which is not infinite  However prior to 105 you essentially have a zero in the thousands and tenths space assuming all digits not written are zeros  yet here I could see it needing notation of an infinitismal as the absence of numbers extends throughout all place values held throughout the number ♾105 ♾,2021-03-16 02:42:36.408604
The difference they net in that is a potential future loss transferred to another firm / person that then bought that short at a higher price from them  It’s still valid and out there but their short attacks increase the price of them which they pass on to someone else,2021-03-16 02:42:36.408717

Well my move for the last 6 weeks has been buying BB otm weeklies ~$1000 worth on mondays and they've all been losers except last week where it basically made mediocre gains    But I'm gonna keep doing it because I'm just that fucking retarded and stubborn,2021-03-16 02:43:57.200186
All this talk about hedge funds attacking when the reality is that there are shit tons of common folks who put some money into it at 150 and got out at 300 because     money  The people who are still hyping it now either got in so early it can go down to 100 and they will still have a a 10 bagger or the idiots who bought after it had been blowing up 5 days already and now have no choice but to hold and try to get as many others to hold as well so they dont lose the farm ,2021-03-16 02:43:58.887078

Now I haven’t understood this but why help your children with college? I’m 24 and while I am fortunate to get some cash from the VA I’ve taken out loans to cover necessities and what have you  My mom lets me stay at home whenever I want to still but during the semesters I’m living on campus it’s also an hour away from home    I know I have some fortunate things like a mother who supports me mentally and emotionally and really pushes for me to make financially sound decisions some people don’t have that  I get that  I understand helping your child with miscellaneous things like paying for laundry detergent or some snacks here and there but paying tuition and everything just seems ludicrous to me  Paying for my own shit really made me start making financially sound decisions  Sure I was taught it but I really understood it when I did it myself  Just wanted to rant a bit about some dumb shit,2021-03-16 02:44:28.070744

Well good news is that it ain’t going to 0 anytime soon  Bad news is that this stock is NOT trading on fundamentals  RC is here to make money  If he isn’t hedging his $8 per share that literally went up 1700% less than a year he isn’t as smart  as I think he is lol,2021-03-16 02:45:45.250923
I haven’t made the transition to full tard yet so I’m probably not the best person to ask - but this news honestly doesn’t change my personal strategy  While I do hold shares I am not buying anymore at these prices  I do like the stock and have sold and continue to sell cash secured puts  If the price drops far enough not only am I buying more but other people will have paid me to buy more  If it moons before I can buy more well I still have my original shares and I’m ok with that  It’s all about your level of risk to value  No other ape can decide that for you ,2021-03-16 02:45:45.251032

It’s not really non-sense when you think about how much of this type of shit has been going on ever since GME became worldwide news and the HF wanted to save their asses  I was really just spit balling a theory that I’ve seen thrown about lately that I just found a bit suspect given the timing of everything that’s been going on  Like I said I don’t think AMC is a bad play I have just seen lots of things happen that are perfectly timed to try and pull people away from GME    Call me delusional idc  Just my opinion ,2021-03-16 02:49:04.859188

I own 120 $GME @ $212  On Monday each week I sell a slightly OTM call for that Friday  Example: Sold 3/19 250C for $6655  I keep the $6655 no matter what  Best case call expires and I do it again next week  Worst case it gets exercised and I make the premium + ~$4K on the stock and then I just buy more shares and start again    And if it starts squeezing during the week I buy back my option at an inflated price of course and hope it keeps going to cover my premium difference plus lots more  That happened last week except the keep going part  I bought to close my 3/12 225C as $GME was hitting $330 and then it turned around and sunk  I lost about $6K btwn my sold 225C and bought 225C but then I just sold the 250C after the price rose and broke roughly even overall ,2021-03-16 02:50:15.421809

It sure would suck if CNBC's parent company ended up losing millions from short sellers after this!

Digit gang represent!  A personal favorite of Dian Fossey Digit never led the troop but he was always willing to back up the silverback whenever anything endangered his family  This noble trait resulted in Digit tragically giving his life to save his family from poachers renewing Fossey’s efforts to protect the mountain gorillas and eventually leading her to establish the Digit Fund now the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund in his honor    FUCK POACHERS,2021-03-16 02:51:17.238409

We like wildlife and decided to spend some gains on it  That wasn't excessive  That's people being kind  You wouldn't tell someone loving in a million dollar house that their valuation of the house is excessive  Well we're holding a high valued stock and the DD heavily backs it  Citadel owes back the stocks  We have the stocks  Therfore in order to get them they have to pay us  The Finra report still says the shorts are there so why would we have reason to think it won't happen? There are three possibilities here  1  Citadel pays interest on the borrowed stocks until they go bankrupt considering they just lent out 600million I O U'sBonds it's pretty clear they are running out  2  The squeeze happens and we get our tendies  3  The squeeze begins to happen and fuckery happens again   Nothing about what we're doing is excessive ,2021-03-16 02:52:43.475113

I bought this morning when they were a penny for a contract so each contract was a dollar  The contract I’m holding now closed at $ 07 when it was up to $ 11  I think it’ll go up still this week but like most trades at lot comes down to FOMC  We’re past the $92 strike so the only barrier we have left is the $95 strike which is what i bought  There wasn’t much open interest tho so it might not be institutions selling those contracts which is good news  I suspected that when there was no hedging at $92  We just easily slid right past it ,2021-03-16 02:53:04.210790

"I appreciate your enthusiasm but want to provide a competing perspective  On the conference call AMCs CEO shared that LA theaters disproportionally represent a large source of their revenue  While other reopenings will potentially create enthusiasm there is an old adage ""buy the rumor sell the news""  Everyone knows they are opening back up it doesn't take any special critical thinking skills to piece that together  AMC in my opinion is not some symbolic bastion of American lifestyle and representative of something more meaningful  It's a company that is in dire need of new revenue streams and has to find a way to adapt and take advantage of the spotlight  Announce a partnership with GME to host gaming tournaments partner with the NFL to have theaters dedicated to games on Monday/Sunday stir up partnership interest from streaming platforms  They need to take advantage of the virality and continue to create ""rumors"" ",2021-03-16 02:58:49.015201

"Basically what he did was he paid a certain premium in order to secure his right to purchase a total of 61 options ""calls"" contract PROVIDED that his strike price was met before its expiration date   IF his strike price wasn't met hint: it obviously wasn't met before the expiration date then the option contract expires worthless   He did not purchase all of these 61 options contracts at once he purchased them with varying strike prices but with the same expiration date of March 12 with the only exception of the last option contract that the purchased with an expiration date of March 19 and a super far-reaching strike price of $510 dollars   Now let me explain in great deals what all that means   A strike price is basically a price where you THINK a stock might reach before your chosen options contract expiration date reaches   Let's use the first options contract that appears on that list as an example: the one that expired on March 12 with a strike price of $360  -  note: don't forget the part that says ""20 buys underneath that options contract it's also very important here   Also before I continue explaining this I need to let you know how many shares would you buy when you buy 1 ONE option contract:  Each option contract gives you the right but not the obligation to purchase 100 shares at your chosen strike price so when you see an options contract valued at $0 01 in reality you would need to pay $0 01 \* 100 in order to buy that options contract the total invested price would be $1 to secure just ONE options contracts   This buyer bought 20 contract calls which mean he paid $20 to secure his right to purchase 100 \* 20 = 2000 GME stocks at a price of $360 with an expiration date of March 12   IF by March 12 the GME stock didn't reach $360 and it didn't then that options contract expires worthless he losses the $20   The other options contract that appears on that list in the order that appears on his screenshot:  2:  He bought 10 options contracts calls with a strike price of: $380 with an expiration date of March 12 with an options price of $0 01 per share   Since we already know that 1 option contract represents the right but not an obligation to purchase 100 shares at your chosen strike price then buying one option contract at a price of $0 01 carries an investment price of $1 a penny times 100 shares basically   He bought 10 options contract calls which means that he invested $10 on that one   3:  10 contracts of GME $275 call with an expiration date of March 12 at a price of $0 01 per share: He paid $0 16 \* 100 shares = $16 00 \* 10 contract = $160 invested on this one   4:   10 contracts of GME $285 call with an expiration date of March 12 at a price of $0 03 per share: He paid $0 03 \* 100 shares = $3 00 = 10 contract = $30 00 invested on this one   5:   10 contracts of GME $330 call with an expiration date of March 12 at a price of $0 01 per share: He paid $0 01 \* 100 shares = $0 01 = 10 contract = $10 00 invested on this one   6:  And finally this one is the ONLY one that has not expired yet but it has a very ridiculous strike price chosen of $510 with an expiration date of March 19   UNLESS GME is valued at $510/share on or BEFORE March 19 that option contract will too expire worthlessly:  1 contracts of GME $510 call with an expiration date of March 19 at a price of $10 58 YIKES!! - thankfully he only bought just 1 contract instead of 10 contracts like he was doing for all the other contracts: He paid $10 58 \* 100 shares = $1058 00 to secure his rights to purchase 100 GME shares at a price of $510 per share IF the price of GME makes it to $510 on or before March 19 2021   If this is NOT the case then he would lose his $1058 that he paid in order to secure this contract   Total amount that he invested on all these 6 covering a total of 61 options contracts: 20 + 10 + 160 + 30 + 10+ 1058 = TOTAL he paid out of his pocket:  $1288 which coincides to what we all see on the top of that screenshot: Contracts: $61 Value: $1288 00  Out of all that $1288 he has so far lost: $230 on every options contract that expired on March 12 worthless   The only option contract he has NOT lost YET is the last one that he paid $1058 with a strike price of $510 and it would NOT take a rocket scientist to assume that he would be losing that one too when March 19 comes and the price of GME hasn't reached at least $510 or greater by that date   He will ONLY win if the price of GME reaches $510 or greater BEFORE march 19 very highly unlikely basically he just played the rich man's lottery   I decided to explain my answer in great detail taking advantage of this to also explain or at least give an idea of house options work at least it's very basics   This answer only covers examples dealing with calls you win if the price goes up and matches or exceeds your chosen strike price this answer doesn't cover Puts which is roughly the opposite of a call   In a very short brief:  Buying a put option allows an investor to benefit from a drop in the price of the underlying asset while also limiting how much loss they may sustain if the price rises   So basically if you are in favor of a stock price appreciating in value you think that a stock price is going to go up in value not down you want to buy a call option contract not a put   Of course the safest approach would be to actually buy the stock directly instead of an options contract and option contract has a finite life span you are limited to the expiration date you chose and you risk your capital if the stock fails to appreciate to your predicted price before the expiration date reaches   Options can be great and an occasional play to a market condition that you are almost certain is going to go in the direction you see it going but it shouldn't be your main investment driving force -- unless you know what you are doing and have a great strategy that is working   If you are getting into options it would be a great idea to toy with a very small percentage of your overall account balance you do not want to go all-in on an options contract - its a huge gamble that can either pay off really REALLY good eg: you hit the jackpot on the rich man's lottery or you could wipe out your entire account balance ",2021-03-16 02:59:27.784053

So    From what I understand about operational shorting after doing a lot of retardsearch is a short position in an operational short *really* gets fucked if there's 5-6 days worth of buy volume in a single day   There was an interesting talk about it from UVA and they used ironically enough XRT as the example  So it's entirely possible that this event has been the test case that wasn't really meant to be tested   Can that much buy volume happen?

BUY AMC IS YOU WANT TO RECOVER,2021-03-16 03:04:02.537796
"> We still must remain apes    I think we should all just do what's best for ourselves  Be united as a group with a goal but be individualistic when it comes to how we enact that goal  What good is a totally stressed out potentially deep in the red ape? We want apes to be strong and being strong means being fearless and being fearless means different things to everyone    > The reverse narrative is taking hold and ruined the buy the deep dip dialogs  No punishment for any hands diamond of paper  I think that ""reverse narrative"" tends to be anything that goes against ""GME 100k!"" which lets be honest apes whats best for the pack is each ape getting theirs  Let them be the decider of what that is for them  Some did not want to buy the dip and it proved to be a successful strategy as there were only two short windows where buying GME would've ended in net gains today  Volume was on the lower end and call option volume was abysmal    I think the brutish nature of the BTD mindset with Apegang was hilarious at first but now it borders on what you'd expect from the intellectually disadvantaged  And its a shame to see so many apes be cast out from a group they dedicated their life savings to simply because they have a *slightly* different opinion and made the mistake of sharing it with a group they thought were their peers    But thats just me big dumbo ape ",2021-03-16 03:04:06.610182
