You can tell GME is just biding time until the moonshot   It’s been consistently in the 200s  It’s not going to stay there  Either it’s going up or down  Right now? There’s too many things going on for it to go down so the only way is up  How high is the question ,2021-03-16 19:28:01.433930

Errrm last week the amount held by institutions was north of 130% per Bloomberg  The current 115% just means there's a bit over 20% of recent transactions that haven't settled yet which makes sense given the recent price fluctuations    Honestly given the week over week trends this seems to suggest that there are far fewer synthetic longs than people initially assumed   ,2021-03-16 19:28:37.055985

saw this quote posted in an entirely different sub but thought it applies to the apes    KEEP HODLING!!!  “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat ”  \-Theodore Roosevelt,2021-03-16 19:30:52.974929

I’m not necessarily saying those deep ITM call options that were sold were naked however as the stock prices increases more and more call options will be ITM - that would force market makers to purchase up shares in the open market to deliver  Evidently we saw last week when the stock price was approaching $350 +which had huge open interests we saw an immediate pullback followed by a halt  Now you can imagine if the ITM call options exceed the number of float market makers are in deep shit ,2021-03-16 19:34:48.953803

“I was invested in GME at $13 therefore I am smart ” GME at $13 was a good investment - at $200 it is much much harder to argue the same  You can of course argue that it will have a magnificently successful transition to online the fundamentals of its brick and mortar business do not justify the current price  This bet on this transition is in no way a bet on fundamentals it’s a purely speculative play  There is no fundamental metric that currently justifies the price whether you look at revenue gross margin profit cash flows the growth rates of these or just about anything else I’m literally looking at all of these values right now - what do you find tempting? The negative profit margin? The negative sales growth? The way above average in comparison to peers they are not Chewy lol sales multiple?  You’re the one saying “it is just fine and even undervalued at this price point” - you should be the one presenting evidence/projections if anything  I fail to see what role GameStop plays in a world where video game makers go increasingly more straight-to-consumer  There will always be an intermediary for pet food and supplies but why for a video game download?

"With wireless power transmission making some pretty great advancements I am almost expecting to see ""charging regions"" where you can get wireless power sent to your car while you're still driving   That would probably be pretty nice to have in places with cheap grid power and a lot of hills  Heck maybe electric semi trucks could act like mobile chargers  If a truck has a relatively full battery at the top of a big hill they could beam power to anyone nearby who wanted it  Then as they motor brake on the way down they have some battery capacity to store the generated power rather than shunting it to a brake resistor  Less heat less wasted power another way of monetizing atrociously inefficient delivery infrastructure    Sounds great ",2021-03-16 19:35:55.188757

Do not be afraid if the stocks are going the opposite way you thought they would this week   I got asked earlier why I thought it would go DOWN tomorrow when that is the day that Stimmys come into play and the hearing is also happening    Not to mention on top of that its also on the week that a lot of calls come into play/quadruple witching AND just before the earnings announcement   It must be right? This is the week  Why would it go down???   We all KNOW without a doubt its going to blow through the roof this week  WELL SO DO THE HEDGEFUNDS - and do you not think they are going to do EVERYTHING they can to avoid that? To scare people away make people convinced it isn't going to happen  Convince everyone its a dead stock its still going down etc Its all over      We know this is the week they know THIS too! - and they will fight tooth and nail even if its costs them a fortune its better than the alternative  What better way if people give up because this aligning of all the signs does not come to pass?  They are backed into a corner  Do not underestimate them  They will throw all they can at this       TLDR - Ive made up my mind no matter the movement around the magic 3/19  Hold  0 or Moon ,2021-03-16 19:36:02.252890

Nope  Synthetic shouldn’t  be counted because they are supposed to be used for long options positions  But we all know this doesn’t stop use in dilution through washing down and covering not closing positions to get GME taken off security threshold  Another important reason for the 3/19 witching are index and futures options expiry  Congressional meetings are wrapping up  GME ER and announcement by April of their respective leadership positions for plans to turn the company profitable with a business transformation  Short positions have slightly closed  But I’d wager not even conservatively 25-30% have closed  Yes I pulled this number from my ass because it’s likely less ,2021-03-16 19:36:18.819826

Maybe just a case of thinking in line with my confirmation bias but:  It's often quite stagnant in AH is this because they don't bother shorting during those hours as they know a lot of us can't even trade in AH so there are no shares for them to pick up  My broker doesn't even act on buy/sell orders in AH/Premarket if I set a buy/sell order it won't do a thing until the 9:30-16:30 EST market window ,2021-03-16 19:37:07.943839

I’d love to open a restaurant that employs people for reasonable hours at a living wage and if I’m rich enough I would happily lose money for years trying to produce a profitable business model for others to emulate   I’ve worked too many places where the owners are in debt and barely scraping by  Then they have their employees suffer for it by understaffing and underpaying  It’s just so irresponsible to open a business if you can’t afford the risk without your employees taking on some of the burden   Example: If I work more than 18 hours I lose my unemployment benefits for the week  The most they can schedule me for is 24 hours  I can’t survive on 24 hours a week  That’s my problem though so they have me scheduled for 24 hours a week  So I just don’t clock in one shift a week ,2021-03-16 19:37:40.043948

It'll take a while before XOM restores pre-pandemic cash flows   due to their hedging they probably have been selling the bulk of their production for much lower than current spot price simply because they have to as part of their hedging because they can't count on parabolic prices to continue   i'll bet when oil was languishing at 20 bucks they sold a lot of their future output in the 30's and 40's rather than current spot  They'll trade below pre-pandemic for a while longer until we can see whether the current spot price is sustainable long term ,2021-03-16 19:38:59.788401

Well    According to MRQ they have $446 million cash on hand  Max dividend they can pay is $6 3988 or so    Yes the dividend would be paltry compared to the stock value even when maxed out but even issuing one when it is so volatile it would be seen as a catalyst    News of a return to regular dividends  like 0 05% even would send a signal about solvency ,2021-03-16 19:42:14.360681

naked shorting is when you sell a stock that doesn’t exist and plan on buying a real stock in the future to replace it  that means there are “real” gme stocks and “synthetic” gme stocks being traded in the market  the percentage is the percentage of “real” gme stock owned  so the percent of stock in the the market is synthetic+real/real > 100%    institutions owning 115% means shorts have to cover the extra 15% the institutions own plus all the stocks retails own,2021-03-16 19:42:53.792092

When AMC reaches what floor?  I own both and just my opinion but GME has more upside   I really think AMC tops out at $20-30   450000000 shares out there make it almost impossible to squeeze   GME could easily hit high hundreds maybe more   The only downside with GME is there is further to fall if it tanks ,2021-03-16 19:45:27.154400

I've said it before and I'll say it again   The day to day means nothing  Look at the perfect cup and handle of the 3m or 1yr chart  This is the most bullish chart I've ever seen  Wall street sees it too that's why big funds and ETF's loaded up on GME last week ARK bought a bunch in preparation for the squeeze   We all read about the $600 million in almost junk bonds by citadel that's just ammo for them to drop the price as much as possible this week and next in hopes that retail investors will panic sell and they can cover enough calls to remain solvent when institutions start calling back their shares ahead of the annual shareholders meeting in June   Just hold for another month and a half and you'll be on the moon or mars when melvin has to come begging for your shares at whatever price you ask for   THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SHAREHOLDERS MEETING IN THE HISTORY OF GAMESTOP  You're a fool if you think the big boys with millions of shares aren't going to call back nearly every single one that melvin and citadel have shorted  They need the votes especially if RC makes plays to set himself up for the CEO position    No GME is not worth $300+ in terms of real value not considering RC and future value potential it's maybe more like $100 or less but what price do you think these guys originally shorted at?  I'll tell you no more than $40 and probably closer to $20 or less  Hell probably a shitload of short interest came up this time last year when Covid hit and short sellers thought GME and the broader retail sector would be killed off entirely  Gme was under $5 at the time    They had the chance to cover everything in February and only lose a few hundred million dollars but they didn't because of hubris  Do you think they're going to cover at $200+? No  They probably won't even cover if it hits $100 because they're greedy  They are going to get fucked in the ass trying to buy back millions of shares at ridiculous prices and they know it ,2021-03-16 19:45:47.975999

Was encouraged to post this here: If you own MDMA stock you need to vote by tomorrow March 17th to avoid a hostile corporate takeover    &#x200B;  Neos has the **ONLY** legalized version of extended-release MDMA and **3 approved drugs**   *This is a big deal *  Why? Because many publicly traded companies have **0 drugs approved** and have **billions of dollars in market capitalization** how much the company is worth  $NEOS has also created a *proprietary* system called NEORx to distribute it's drugs since they're controlled substances   **3 High potential FDA approved drugs a proprietary delivery system AND it's in a market valued as high as $25 BILLION**  So why has NEOS made a deal to sell itself to Aytu Biosciences where we its current shareholders get ONLY 30% of the future company?  NEOS got a bid from [PDLI in 2018 for $10 25]https://www insidearbitrage com/dealsintheworks/neos-therapeutics-neos-approached-by-pdl-biopharma-pdli/ per share because they understood what big potential there is with this patented XR MDMA drug  Aytu on the otherhand is offering 30 cents  In the ADHD space *drugs with this classification typically are sold for hundreds of millions or billions * Aytu is offering $44 9 million which is literally pennies in this space   Seems crazy that $NEOS management has done this when they could've tried to raise money through the stock market  *Right now itś the best time for micro small cap companies with high potential assets like NEOS to sell stock to investors to grow their companies*  BULL AF! So why are they choosing to give $NEOS away to a lame ass company like Aytu that has NO growth prospects at all  T**his deal is a terrible one for NEOS shareholders  If you own NEOS stock we are getting FUCKED  And if you want MDMA therapy in the future this basically kills XR MDMA being successfully rolled out  It's like watching a unicorn about to get shot and people are voting yes to shooting the unicorn without understanding why that's bad **  Here's how we can fix this from getting shafted:  1  If you own NEOS vote NO YES NO  2  If you don't own NEOS buy a stock  Then you'll get a ballot and you can vote on this merger between NEOS and Aytu   *They use jargon to intentionally confuse people that don't understand how this works people like us that aren't necessarily in finance*  **When they say you agree to this merger aka Aytu stealing NEOS from it's shareholders and giving them an insultingly low deal tell them to go fuck themselves and vote NO **  **When they ask you if you're cool with NEOS doing a reverse split vote YES **  **When they ask if it's cool for NEOS management to keep canvassing to get approval for this terrible merger say FUCK NO **  The point of this is twofold  First by saying NO to these questions you will stop this merger from going through and end up saving a high potential company with valuable useful drugs that many people will be helped by  Second NEOS management is going to be forced to look at alternative to this terrible merger Ex: raising more money through the stock market or shopping the company to someone that will give NEOS shareholders better value for their shares  They've gotten deals in the past turned them down but clearly this time around Aytu is trying to steal this company and it's up to us the shareholders to stop them! We believe in this stock we like this stock there's no other MDMA like it and we are in a time of a therapeutic and pharmaceutical renaissance  Aytu is not as good as they may seem online and they have a history of sucking  SAVE NEOS SAVE MDMA therapy!,2021-03-16 19:48:37.333207

If you have a choice to use any tool to get the answer lots of finance ppl are on jumping on the python or R train  Way easier to do lots of fancy shit it’s repeatable easy to automate and MUCH less prone to errors    Teaching yourself excel is a huge pain I know I’ve done it and most firms worth a damn will drool when you say you have python/R proficiency   Sauce: IT product owner that supported accounting fincance and trading @ large private firm   Vlookup hlookup index match and pivot tables should get you pretty far and if you know a little Visual Basic coding you can look like a badass by doing automation in visual basic for applications and write VBA macros  If you’re gonna learn some programming don’t focus on VBA - python and R is where it’s at   Something I’ve always dropped on anybody I’ve talked to about excel is this formula  It will do a horizontal compare of a1 and b1 and if it matches it will print MATCH MFer! if not no match will appear in the formula cell  Keep in mind data types can mess this up sometimes  Kinda excited to drop this in a public forum bc there’s probably a way easier way to do this and someone will be quick to correct me   =ifiserrormatcha1b10”no match””MATCH MFer!”  Protip run far far away from any company that relies heavily on excel/access for their key processes - ie stuff other than adhoc reporting and prototyping,2021-03-16 19:49:38.216389

From a technical standpoint all tech stocks are still a very strong buy especially those that defended their 20MA in that drill  Many ran up crazy fast so a breather was in order and historically following corrections this is the exact point is does so  I expect maybe some more sideways for another day or two but with stimmy money entering the market tomorrow I think we resume ripping by the end of the week  Now if JPow goes on and says ‘fuck your stocks’ that thesis is invalidated but I imagine he is aware of how his last talk influenced the market and will be very careful and calculated to resume the pump but I would probably fade me ,2021-03-16 19:51:04.125012

Returning to the gold standard is both literally impossible and also a form of fiat currency   Anyone who believes that moving to a gold backed currency will solve more problems than it creates doesn't understand how currency works  Or how gold works did you know that it's necessary for electronics? Do you understand the effects of the source of value for a currency being a resource required for basically every industry?****  There is about $10 trillion of gold ever dug up  Worldwide  How much is still on the market? How much still is accessible? Impossible to tell   Moving to a gold backed currency will destroy economy of any nation that tried  Even post economic failure it will never be possible for gold to back a currency  Unless society as a whole collapses in some apocalyptic future the amount of people alive and the amount of goods and services that must be exchanged make a gold economy unfeasible ,2021-03-16 19:52:51.694720

Every time somebody decides to sell a position to buy back at a lower price but with more shares they extend their FTD dates!!! I understand we all want more GameStop shares but in this case selling at the peak and buying at the dip is just helping them kick the can down the road even longer  They buy your share and give you a naked one  DO YOU REALLY WANT JUST THE BANANA PEEL OR THE WHOLE BANANA 🍌  KEEP YOUR REAL FUCKING SHARES APES! REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A GAME OF CHESS AND THEY CANT CHECKMATE US BECAUSE WE HAVE TOO MANY KINGS AND QUEENS 💎🙌🏻  simple way to put it  ⬇️⬇️⬇️  Greedy Ape: Hmm I want to have more money when the squeeze kicks off   🤔🤔🤔 *Checks Fintel*  The hedge funds borrowed 1 6Million shares so I predict a dip   *Proceeds to sell at market for profit*  *1 Hour later buys the dip and now has more shares*  now has a few more shares but at what cost my friend 😔 you have fake shares and you are team killing our fellow 🦧🦍 I’ve held since Jan and if your a veteran by now you know citadel has no pants 😳  And remember SPREAD DD the best thing you can do is buy as an individual investor and secondly spread important Due Diligence   Almost forgot to mention my new floor is 2 000 000 paperhanding a few at 1 000 000 sorry guys ,2021-03-16 19:53:54.796542

Is PLUG really a long term play? they are a traditional plugin charge company  I think the future of EV’s should rely upon the accessibility of a quick and sustainable charging system   I’ve researched EV’s and how they can actually have staying power for the future  One solution is Inductive Charging Systems  They are a better solution for commercial and public transport EV’s in the future  I’m not knocking on PLUG as it can maintain a sustainable retail market    But the largest consumer is commercial and they are being held back in acquiring EV’s mostly because of the lack of range and large amount of downtime they currently have   Some good ICS companies out there include: $WATT  $BLNK  $IDEX and others    As always do your own DD and this is not financial advice  I just like the EV industry,2021-03-16 19:54:27.076646

Would not surprise me if it opens higher tomorrow morning   Stimmie's only enough for say   5 shares instead of 7   Doesn't seem like much but extrapolate that across potentially 10's of thousands of apes and now you have a pretty big number difference     Interesting thought!!!,2021-03-16 19:55:30.243737

Am I the only one who read/listened to any of DFV's original DD?  Shares must be called in by April 20 in order to vote in the June shareholders meeting  THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MEETING IN THE HISTORY OF GME!!! In the weeks leading up to April 20th we will see unstoppable growth as the shorts transition from tanking the stock to buying whatever they can and trying to bring the price down at the same time of course because their lenders are demanding the borrowed shares back   I could honestly see melvin and citadel calling shenanigans to the SEC and uncle Sam because of how much they're going to lose  They'll claim millions of americans will lose their 401k if they go bankrupt  Which is partly true but we all know the Fed will find a few trillion laying around read: printed on the toilet paper that is fiat currency and bail out the fuckers   Be prepared for more RH bullshit like limiting selling to 5 shares per person and shit like that  There is no doubt in my mind that this will be a bloody battle and retail will not come out on top if we don't time things correctly  Don't get too greedy and,2021-03-16 19:58:57.514330

You ever thought what is the point of living? Think about it you gain stuff through out  life just to lose everything its not like you are progressing towards something  Sure you get to leave a legacy but still in a few years humans will go extinct or the universe will go dark forever  So what was the point of it all? The best way to give meaning to keep your stuff is to live in an endless simulation where you can store your brain and live in your own reality where 1 sec in real life would equal to millions of years in your reality  Only Nvidia can achieve this this is why you should buy Nvidia   Thats my DD,2021-03-16 19:59:13.175598

Can someone explain to me the gamma squeeze one more time? The post I read that explained gamma squeezes said the MMs continually buy shares to delta hedge as delta increases  If so then that makes it a momentum play    If it works the way I understand it then that rapid drop last week could have shifted the momentum so now we could be seeing a gamma squeeze in reverse with MMs continually unhedgeding on options  It could make sense since we don’t see a lot of buyers and sellers  But I am retarded so someone please tell me how I’m wrong in a way a retard understands ,2021-03-16 20:03:32.885708

Volatility is the only way you can “get rich quick” but it’s assuredly not the only way to see significant gains in the stock market   For what it’s worth SPY a much less volatile option tracking the S&P 500 has more than tripled in the past 10 years so unless you were making a minimal investment at that time your returns there were likely much more than $1k during those 10 years ,2021-03-16 20:06:50.830397

Remember that after hours volume is so small and is so insignificant on the overall price that most brokerages don't even report it  Don't look at a graph all night and worry about the price going down when there's less than 0 1% of the average volume being exchanged  AH is only interesting when there's a TON of volume out of nowhere either due to FED'S or something happening with a MM or whale ,2021-03-16 20:07:38.406642

Setting deadlines only sets you up for disappointment  This is a fight between longs and shorts mostly institutional investors but our retarded asses are in there too   The shorts will try anything and everything they can  They'll fight as dirty as possible  Why? They're cornered and fighting for survival  Don't expect them to roll over and die   All the longs have to do is HODL  Buying is great but buying ITM or very close to ITM calls is even better   Shorts will have to buy our shares eventually  A catalyst could make that sooner than later but this could take months ,2021-03-16 20:07:40.197228

If it does trade flat until March 23rd that could be the next catalyst for a huge explosion in stock price  You will have a double whammy of earnings news combined with the drop in IV after earnings - making calls bought after earnings a REALLY TEMPTING thing  I could see a rocket at March 25th ,2021-03-16 20:08:54.137299

It's not the earnings itself but I think that the forward guidance conversation will be interesting  I'm hoping to hear a more concrete vision for the direction of the company  At $200 a share GME is a $14B company right now that did $5B in sales last year  If they demonstrate a path to profitablity and can leverage the billions of dollars worth of free advertising they're getting right now from all of this there's still upside value potential,2021-03-16 20:08:57.003975
Given that a lot of those people just joined the sub within the last month due to GME being in the news probably  Then you factor in that most people are just lurkers here watching the show  Even that 1% is probably high ,2021-03-16 20:08:58.108737

I'm not the best at this  But ill put me in your shoes  I expect price rise $25 to $35 by whatever date  Personally I'd purchase a 30c 33c 35c  The highest value I may sink a week back and try to sell it for premium since that's the highest risk  I also like to grab a put for every week I hold calls as a hedge  Usually they're cheap in that case below profit basis    If the 35 goes very green off the bat sell while theta is low and roll it into a put to hedge your 30c same week  Get it close to the 30 any price between those is where you lose   Look up bullish spreads for gooder info ,2021-03-16 20:09:13.106047

Anybody else in the know and sitting back/relaxing while watching the absolute beauty that hedge funds are pulling off? They are convincing retail buyers that GME is a discount at $188 31  This is literal modern day Mona Lisa - marketing at its finest  If you bought and are holding GME make no mistake you *fell* for it  Millions of dollars are likely being poured in to run all of these opinion bots to influence your actions so don't feel too bad about it when you become one of bagholders at $100+,2021-03-16 20:09:56.876543

While they obviously differ in the exact method of which they acquired wealth the fundamentals are the same; both amassed their riches through the exploitation of others namely the working class  Musk did so in the typical billionaire fashion with underpaid workers shitty worker environments and most famously apartheid  There are many many more examples  Where they can take shortcuts for a profit increase they do so    Another similarity is that they both profited off the COVID-19 pandemic  Musk pushed for Tesla factory workers to be forced to continue work despite the company receiving a large amount of funding from the government during the initial stimulus bill to keep them afloat while workers couldn’t work  Others were furloughed and had their salaries cut  Musk of course also later criticized Congress members for poison pill stimulus bills that put money into corporate pockets conveniently neglecting to mention his role in that  Hypocrisy at its finest    This is in comparison to hedge funds like Melvin that took advantage of the pandemic to short sell the hell out of companies that had grim prospects often resorting to naked shorts which are on paper at least illegal  But we all know that much   While I personally do see the humour in Musk forcing the US government to support his LARPing because it is pretty funny and I 100% would do the same Musk is by no means a person to look up to  It’s cool that at the very least he puts some of his wealth to good use for humanity SpaceX and such but he’s still in the same league as hedge funds and other billionaires  He may pull a Bill Gates and try to make amends later in life but for the time being he is not our friend,2021-03-16 20:10:27.161899

"The cash is the capital    If you have more you can take bigger positions   Remember not all their positions are purchases where you just pay cash  They're required to keep collateral in order to expand to other things    Also keep in mind they aren't just an investment company in fact they primarily are not  They're a FinTech company and also need to just finance their actual activities    They've also done a ton of acquisition might be more of that    In general any company wants as much debt as possible It's usually the lowest cost of capital    Don't think of it as giving up 3% of gains think of it as additional gains they couldn't otherwise get and it costs 3% to do it    So if you could make 11% on an additional 600 Million you'd do it    Again I'll point to literally any other financial company   RBC issued 1 billion Euro in bonds today   they have $137 Billion in Cash  They don't ""need"" another $1 billion  But they'll still benefit from having it means they can invest more lend more whatever",2021-03-16 20:14:10.189918

Regarding the stimulus checks there are plenty of reasons they won't have a huge immediate impact   For all the FUD we see MSM has a much stronger hold over the general public and many people literally think buying gme is illegal   Many wsb members have spent the 1400 on gme already in anticipation   It's definitely a promising day but with constant downward pressure from HFs it might not break us out of where we've been   That's fine they are bleeding while we make memes and eat crayons,2021-03-16 20:17:57.147640

Why is it grotesque?   It's not like the guy thinks he's the title  Making jokes about what the media says about him is great  What other billionaires do that kind of shit? He's human instead of just money  You're basically saying he's not allowed to be human because he's rich and that right is held only by poor people   That's insane   And you probably wonder why wealthy people often want nothing to do with people who aren't wealthy? This shit  This type of shit right here is why  The negativity for no reason other than because someone is wealthy which is basically the same as negativity due to any other characteristic of a person  I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this ,2021-03-16 20:18:50.191047
He's just generating profit not shorting the stock   He was short stock it is theoretically indefinite until he buys back   Selling a call has a definite end game and is quite different   Of course the WSB is to roll on past $300 anyway so he can lose his money if he wants to ,2021-03-16 20:18:50.869375

That’s what this whole thing has been about  The “something” that can force them will likely be when they run out of liquidity to pay the fee for borrowing their shorted shares this could take ages hence the holding    I BELIEVE not 100% that you were right though and there is indeed a possibility we are holding synthetic shares they aren’t real  But if that’s the case the fault lies with the ones who created these shares and so they are still on the hook to pay us for it    I’m no expert fairly new here  But yeah shit’s fucked and that’s why we’re all here!,2021-03-16 20:19:49.969994

>Typically: Put options= short  Call options= long  Why is selling calls that are just above our current price shorting it and cause for backlash?  This is only correct if you look at the buy side  There are two persons involved though: someone is selling those calls  By selling a call you collect a premium and hope your call won't get assigned  If the option expires OTM you make money - the premium  If your call will be assigned the potential risk is unlimited  If you don't own the stock you have to buy it at current market price   Same goes for Puts  By selling a put you are actually bullish on the stock   SO TL;DR:Buying Call Selling Put = BullishSelling Call buying Put = Bearish,2021-03-16 20:21:33.481716

Someone seriously please help a smooth brain figure out how a 10 19% short on the float means a rocket is imminent? It's got ~1 5 million more shorts in the last month but I honestly don't understand how any of this equates with the price of rice in China with 1 61b outstanding and 0 65% short outstanding,2021-03-16 20:21:56.577618

I have looked at your PDF and I still disagree  In general WSB isnt doing market manipulation with GME because WSB it's not a collective organised group and manipulation is against WSB policy should be reported    If someone here was sending out emails and paying for ads to do specific things then yes that is manipulation and is banned from WSB  Posting an opinion on a PUBLIC forum is not market manipulation  Telling someone to buy and hold isnt market manipulation that is a core feature of investing - everyone should be doing that   Even posts explaining why options can cause gamma squeeze isnt market manipulation    Majority of posts here dont have specific steps to take but would fall under opinion and most the DD could be in a finance paper    Does the odd user attempt market manipulation? Sure- as above literally anyone in the world can post here  A 12 yo kid could be telling people to hail DFV and all buy options on Thursday to trigger gamma  Plotkins himself could be posting here trying to manipulate in his favour   Theses posts should be reported as they go against WSB policy  Naturally an open public forum will have people attempting all sorts of things ,2021-03-16 20:22:08.043217

I mean what's better - forcing MM to buy 4000 shares of the stock at a cost of $200 to write your options contracts or buying 1 share for $200  Options make this pop off not shares    and only when the IV drops enough ,2021-03-16 20:22:12.365668

It doesn’t really work that way   Options pricing isn’t a result of IV it’s the other way around     If you want to see for yourself find a very illiquid options chain no open interest no one is trading it you could put out an ask price under the current one and the IV changes accordingly    The people/market trading options and what they are willing to pay for any particular contract determines the price of that contract  IV is derived from that price   Generally speaking more volatile stocks have higher IVs but the IV is not derived directly from the actual volatility of the stock ,2021-03-16 20:22:12.993984
