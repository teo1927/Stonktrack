"Options often have very wide spreads   That's why Citadel pays so much for the flow   They can fill anywhere inside the posted spread and still meet their ""best execution"" requirement   Congress or the SEC does need to do something about this but it's not clear how to address it   The problem is that as more orders are filled off-exchange the spreads on the exchanges get wider and the ""best execution"" requirement gets more meaningless which means that MMs can fill at worse prices which means that they can pay more for order flow which moves more traffic off exchanges which makes the spreads wider etc etc   It's a downward sprial     They need to redefine ""best execution"" in a way that takes more than exchanges into account   I have no idea how though ",2021-03-18 02:20:39.064950

Yup those same thoughts has lead me to have discussions with my parents about their IRA’s  If the market suffers even a moderate correction from the GME squeeze the psychology of panic kicks in around the market and it would drive it all further down affecting retirement accounts that have no correlation with GME and other major securities  I’m worried my parents could get hit pretty hard from this    Do I have a solution? Not really  Feels too alarmist to tell my parents to cash out their IRA’s even tho they are past the age for tax penalties  So I just told them to shift some mutual fund positions in their portfolios  There is a part of me that really wants to be wrong about this,2021-03-18 02:20:53.325160

I’m at the highest level but that doesn’t mean things I do don’t require collateral  Like I can sell naked calls but they reduce my buying power by a ton  Like I said a deep OTM call on SPY needs 8k in collateral in cash  They deduct 8k from my account and release it after the option expires  And that’s a very safe one if you go volatile like gme the collateral for a naked call at a strike of 250 expiring this Friday is 60k dollars      All that’s to say they hold enough collateral so there’s a safe cushion and they don’t lose money  They also liquidate if you get close to your collateral not being enough a margin call basically  How’s harm subjective? It’s only subject with people when their feelings are involved not corporations  Your broker is not gonna have its heart broken that you lied   Lying does violate good faith expectations but who cares? Everyone lies on these applications  If it was a consequential and important thing they’d confirm your answers  The fact that they don’t tells you what you need to do  Businesses always do due diligence when it comes to these thing if it matters    Also these questions and answers are required by regulation not something brokers came up with  It’s a yet another stupid bureaucratic roadblock government added to protect exceptionally stupid people  Most brokers would probably unlock everything for you without asking questions if it wasn’t for the regulations ,2021-03-18 02:22:41.251441

You selling and rebuying on another broker is counterproductive to our goal  It allows shorts to cover with your shares  Just keep that in mind  Robinhood still has to deliver them whether they bought them when your account showed they did or not  Just food for thought my friend  Transfers don’t allow shorts to cover but I know it could tie up your shares for a bit  I would consider holding out on RH if you can ,2021-03-18 02:23:49.487883

There is no proof for any of this  Not a single actual source was cited  GME dropped to $40 and stayed at $40 for almost a month  This is when the original shorts would have covered  Any new shorts are not at the rock bottom prices of $4 and are much easier to cover  And we know float is way below what it was last year we just had a release not too long ago  Some of you have to ask yourselves if this a campaign to get apes to hold heavy GME bags ,2021-03-18 02:25:06.065581

"It's been the moving of the goal post for me  I'll admit that I had 1/2 of my shares on the 420 69 limit sell but that was my original *meme* PT I couldn't believe it had gone that far to begin with  Then watching people put more on the line than I at a way higher cost avg in the name of fucking hedge funds led me kicking the can down the road with them since it didn't cost me any extra to do so  I've now since reinvested a decent amount I made from the first run into it but watching the sentiment turn from ""150 isn't a meme"" to 300 to 420 to 1k all of a sudden to 100k 500k ***per share***??

"I'm not a moneymonkey but take some DD on the technical aspects on AMDs products  Some of this is ""AMD good"" and some of it is ""Intel bad""    Obligatory: This is not financial advice  Feel free to take it as technical advice though  I'll send a bill   First some 30 second elevator-pitch-oneliners:  - Nvidia's top-of-the-line DGX-compute servers use AMD - Intel got burnt *badly* by spectre and meltdown the effects are still there - AMD is packing some seriously innovative features for securing virtualization  If I were buying for AWS Azure or GCE now Intel probably wouldn't be on the radar unless I got some substantial bribes    But the main point of why AMD will whip Intel for the foreseeable future is *chiplets*   AMD can make *smaller chips* have *higher yields* and avoid the multisocket-solutions Intel is stuck with  AMD can supply ridiculous amounts of cores connected to each other and sharing the same io-lanes cheap 14nm controller and cache  Of particular interest *AMD can keep the latency consistently decent between the cores* - they are physically very close to each other  Meanwhile over at Intel you still need a dual-socket system to compete with AMDs core-count and IO  But those sockets communicate over a slow QPI-bus and are physically separated so while the best case latency between two cores is excellent on same die the worst case is a long trip over a stupid wire on the motherboard that is at least 5cm of copper  Also a bitch to program efficiently    As an additional point of failure for Intel they are still on 14nm  They are getting really fucking good at that 14nm-node but at this point the only thing they can do is to increase TDP  Look at their latest lineup *decreasing* core-count to allow for frequency-boosts within a reasonable  TDP  Gamers won't care that much about performance/watt but for data centers and laptops it's huge  For example high-performance computing centers will burn more money on electricity and cooling than the hardware so performance/watt is the only relevant metric for some large costumers    Further down the line DDR5-memory is coming bringing obligatory ECC to the table  Support for ECC-memory is a major deal for servers and most workstations  AMD has had ECC enabled on *all* new desktop and server CPUs from the cheapest Ryzen and up  On Intels side ECC is at this point the only relevant differentiator between their consumer i3/5/7/9-series and their workstation Xeons  *That differentiator will disappear* and suddenly Intels lineup is just really fucking weird  Intels entire workstation-lineup will be gone  Their other major differentiator is multi-socket support which we already bashed  So Intels lineup will probably be a fucking mess for a few years    On a technical level the thing I think could sink AMD is if Intel starts poppin out server-chips with high core-counts >=64 *on a smaller node* in the near future  But that won't happen  Intels smaller nodes are not mature enough for chips of that size to have high enough yield  But even if Intel got their shit under control with regards to their fabs *AMD will always have higher yields due to their chiplet design*     The major non-technical risk I see with AMD is TSMC  They need to be able to keep up with the demand from large OEMs Dell HPE    otherwise OEMs will be forced to go with Intels shitty product regardless  AMD has a license to print money but the printer is just so fucking slow  Intel on the other hand has no supply issues they have their own shittier fab   Speaking of fabs: Many people are mentioning AMDs new GPUs and comparing them to Nvidia  At this point I don't think the product matters the only relevant thing is what company can get their chips manufactured  Every single chip they make will be bought at whatever price they want  Basically another license to print money regardless of how AMD compares to Nvidia    Now the future:  Can AMD print enough money to gain a persistent technical lead and market share from Intel before Intel stops hugging their 14nm-fabs? Probably    Could they surpass Nvidia on the GPU-front? Probably not  They could be a worthy competitor but Nvidia has the upper hand  In particular Nvidia bought Mellanox which should give them huge benefits when it comes to compute-GPU which relies on high-speed interconnects  But every compute-node from Nvidia produced in the foreseeable future will probably have an expensive AMD-CPU     Short term the question is simple - Can they print enough money?",2021-03-18 02:25:37.767653

The number 1 thing depressing this stock was the fear of an interest rate increase depressing housing demand and refinancing demand going forward   The announcement yesterday by the fed that rates will be held at these levels til 2023 triggered upward movement yesterday and cleared the run way for the next 2 years   The fed announcement on interest rates coupled with the Russell index inclusion means this isnt the stock you traded 3 weeks ago  Sorry you bought during a high but this is a pure VALUE PLAY at these levels ,2021-03-18 02:27:12.238861

   if only one brokerage is limiting buying? Uh any other brokerage then? I was asking about that  Obviously if the SEC shuts it down it’s done for “30 days” as someone in a comment had made  But if I don’t know RH decides you can’t buy something anymore only sell it well people on TD Etrade Fidelity etc  can still buy  Sound familiar?,2021-03-18 02:27:13.429878

Someone please explain this to me in terms an 🦧 can understand     RH and other 0 commision investors make money on the spread from the ask to the bid right?  Do they actively delay your ask until it makes sense to them?  They still have to pay themselves a broker on the floor and a clearinghouse right?  And what difference does it make going with other apps?  Don't they all essentially do the same thing to make 0 commision trades?  I trade with Fidelity and it never says anything on the commission line my trades always go through essentially immediately and there is usually a miniscule difference from what i thought i was buying for and what i actially buy for but i thought that was just in the time delay from when i last refreshed on an active market   ,2021-03-18 02:27:16.863235

Lidar is doomed vision will win  I consider winning as achieving an order of magnitude less probability of an accident compared to human drivers   **1st argument Why vision is sufficient:**   P1  Humans can drive make vehicle control decisions using only visual input from a single field of view   P2  Vision based systems can consume 360 degree fields of view and process the information faster than a human can with a single field of view    C: Vision based systems can drive significantly safer than humans  **2nd argument why lidar is insufficient:**  P1  A self driving system must be able to drive in rain snow and fog  P2  LIDAR does not function rain snow and fog  C  LIDAR is insufficient to create a self driving system   &#x200B;  Other points not as formally constructed:  * Lidar is expensive vision systems are not * Lidar cannot penetrate solid objects and 'see through' obstacles ahead  Radar can and is used to augment vision systems  Radar is not expensive * The long as fuck tail of edge cases makes solving self driving a data-aggregation and model architecture problem  Tesla is collecting the most amount of real world driving data with a schema purpose built to train its autopilot engine  They have created a process to solve the biggest hurdle in self driving * Simulated driving data only gets you so far because of the above point  Further its a chicken/egg problem  If you could realistically simulate real world driving you would by definition have a realistic self driving system * Since vision is sufficient and cheap and lidar is expensive and insufficient lidar is not economically useful aka doomed in self driving * Things like hitting curbs bugs in Tesla FSD weird edge cases are an ML problem can can be solved with retraining and improving model architecture  These are not problems where vision fundamentally fails    Don't get me wrong I think Waymo and the other self driving companies are cool AF and the people working there are a lot smarter than I am but I think eventually they will all build vision first systems and abandon Lidar    My predictions to first production FSD:  1  Tesla 2  Comma 3  Whoever does the third working vision system,2021-03-18 02:28:59.675088

"Alright you're giving me a headache let's take a look at margin calls on synthetic or naked shorts a short can go synthetic or naked based if Bob asked Jerry if he has a stock to borrow Jerry says yes Bob doesn't borrow right away John borrows it but because Bob located a stock he was allowed to short it and sell it  Depending on the amount and the brokerage a margin account has to have 25-30% of the loan  ""Margin trading is regulated by the federal government and other self-regulatory agencies in an effort to mitigate potentially crippling losses for both investors and brokerages""  This is one of the things I call a fraud stop and yes I DID come up with the term its just easier for my brain ok?  But we're naked shorting meaning we really don't have that stock right? Right so we're actually in debt 70-75% of the shorted stock but we sold the stock and made that 100% back right? Uh-oh the stock went up so I actually have to buy back that stock that I never had and because of that I'm actually sub-100% and because I only need 25% to be margin called I can technically let the stock go up 400% and still have enough to cover my calls  Now im margin called and I can't cover the 25% so they make me sell      but I cant    so I fail to deliver  Well now if I'm understanding this right I owe the brokerage a large sum of money theres a share out there that I never had so I have to buy that share and now me and the brokerage is up shit creek without a paddle because the money and share don't exist  I also tried finding the original article as to why naked shorting is illegal I read it a while ago and it covered reported several people between 2012 and 2015 who were fined 90k-250k and had an average jail time of 7 to 15 years because they lied or helped people about their income and availability to cover these losses unfortunately I can't find it and most articles I've found are linked to IRS income fraud or just say the same old shit that ""you report your income and how much experience and if you're conservative or aggressive to your brokerage so if things go to court they can wash their hands of this"" which again is another thing I call fraud stop  If I'm wrong about this I'm wrong but honestly I don't care at this point good luck to ya and hope you make your money and live a happy life im gonna play it safe and just report correctly",2021-03-18 02:29:07.274819

Excellent points here  I think what you could and should also consider are the quasi-shorts those that have sold naked calls  Let's say you sold a ton of naked calls at 250 and you want to keep selling them because  fuck have you seen what they sell for??? You want to keep the price below 270ish so no one exercises the itm but not profitable call but ideally just below 250 so you can keep selling otm calls but you also want to keep the proce high enough to create hope  210 to 220 sounds perfect for me  Now you could do this at any price but it looks like the market the float the buying interest short attacks  fear etc has settled on the low 200s as sustainable ,2021-03-18 02:29:17.341212

Hm  That might be the exit strategy that both a wouldn’t piss off anybody **too** much and b would prevent our entire financial system from collapsing    Say the price of GME gets to $10000 - the point at which Citadel and Melvin would have to liquidate everything they have in order to buy back their stocks that they sold short and transitively point just before which brokerages such as Fidelity etc would have to start using their own funds to cover what Citadel and Melvin can’t - Fidelity could just shut off trading completely and give every single investor the option to sell however many shares they want at exactly $10000  This way everyone gets to cash out or they can take the gamble and hold on to some or all of their shares to see how far this thing goes    - All the shorts get covered   - The financial system stays intact   - All the GME hodlers get rich   - Citadel and Melvin go bankrupt for their poor decisions  - Everyone’s happy    Seems like the best option to me  But don’t listen to me  I’m just an ape ,2021-03-18 02:30:23.164647

To start with the funds who short sold the stock   After that it would be the brokerage RH Fidelity et  al  then the DTCC   A few hedge funds could go down easily   No one gives a shit about them anyway   Some smaller brokerages could fall too   I doubt it would get any further than that   The numbers people are throwing around aren't realistic even in a short squeeze   There might be a few holding some token shares to see where it goes but everyone else will be selling like crazy if it breaks a few thousand   If it actually go to $5000 and the full float sold and it can't because some of it is tied up by insiders and institutions that can't actively trade them that's $300 billion   Papa Musk could almost write a check for that   It's not going to bring down the economy at that level ,2021-03-18 02:31:13.365750

Oh nooooo someone on the internets called me a bad name what will I do now? I get it people who do dumb things like to sit in their echo chamber and be jerked off by other people doing the same dumb things  That’s why you can find 20+ meaningless GME posts for every post about any other stock or with any real substance at all  I just feel bad for these poor people seeing all these posts and think that somehow it’s proof that it’s even a halfway good idea to throw their savings at this stock because they’ve been “assured” that it will rocket  We saw it last time and we will see it again  But at least the first time you could understand how it happened  This time it’s just sad  There’s no “hold the line” there’s just the people making money off the spikes and the people left holding bags  This isn’t going to have any lasting effect if anything the HFs will figure out how to make sure it never happens again ,2021-03-18 02:33:29.268338

I've accidentally sold stocks while I was trying to transfer out of RH once on impulse and once because of a stop loss  Finally got my positions over to Fidelity yet all that will happen is that you won't be able to complete the transfer because the stocks you specified aren't in your account at the time  At least that was my experience so take it with a grain of salt  Maybe try calling up Fidelity and talking to one of their advisors about it they're pretty chill ,2021-03-18 02:33:43.533932

"Chairman of Interactive Brokers said GNE would be ""in the thousands"" if GME wasn't halted in January   He didn't specify if he meant under 10K or above it yet even at say 9K a share someone is getting 3K for only $100   Not bad at all ",2021-03-18 02:34:05.239144

"Agreed  Been here a long time  Recently saw BOTH of the purple mattress guys get called shills in their posts and ""pump"" and ""dumpers "" Like what the fuck? Those guys are OGs here  If they want to post saying they took a shit I'd upvote it   Additionally I like coming here because it can put tickers on my radar that wouldn't have been otherwise  A few people put UWMC on my radar and I decided to put a bet on the company  In my personal opinion when I bought in it was a GREAT fucking bet and it still is  Now those same people trying to put UWMC on other people's radars are being called shills?  Unbelievable that people with 2 months under their belt think they can come to the community that we built and say it should be their way   However I do also agree that most of the people here are retards and should be protected from pump and dumpers ",2021-03-18 02:34:11.993814

Not really no   Sentience+sapience is the cutoff beyond which evolution is fundamentally untenable   Things which evolve follow a relatively linear evolution for whichever time scale they experience generationally   Additionally they experience environmental constraints from which they derive their imperatives/drives   However harsh and unforgiving an environment is be it natural or societal is however extreme their imperatives and drives need to be for their existence   There might be some ambiguity here in terms of species which evolved in harsh environments vs relative paradises but generally an organism will always maximize population for a given set of resources so it can be assumed that the overwhelming majority or species evolve in ""harsh"" environments even if only because some environmental stressors and constraints are required to facilitate evolution   This ""harshness"" of environment can be seen from an experiential perspective as about on par as what we see as surviving in the world to be somewhat tautologically because of the fact it's what we see and what we've evolved for   But again this whole process is linear from an evolutionary perspective   Barring extreme events culling substantial portions of _very_ diverse populations there are no exponential changes and the few there are are short-lived as populations take time to recover from such events   Technology as a whole is evidence of this: it's literally the solution not a good one to The Fermi Paradox   Organisms evolve over relatively linear scales technology on the other hand compounds upon itself with each advancement building upon or leading to more advancements   In turn once a species evolves to the point wherein they see technology as a viable tool or solution to literally any problem they begin augmenting their environment or their experiential perspective of it at an exponential rate as each organism is hard-wired to optimize for those innate imperatives/drives whatever they may be which were conferred from a linear evolutionary process and were wired in contrast to their environment to equalize/balance their existence within it   What this means in short is that once a species develops technology they're already effectively extinct if they continue to adhere to evolutionary standards; and if they don't well good luck with that because there's no basis for knowing a better solution at that point   ^^^This ^^^is ^^^not ^^^financial ^^^advice ^^^and ^^^I ^^^am ^^^not ^^^a ^^^professional ^^^everyone ^^^here ^^^is ^^^an ^^^actual ^^^retard ",2021-03-18 02:35:39.755322

"Title says ""Why the MOASS is real"" but then you don't say why it's real     Yet this has 14k upvotes based on pure hope?  As someone questioned me when I claimed that what we are really seeing is a SQUEEZE TRAP I will forward the question to you: What evidence do you have?  The volume is dead  These contract expiration dates you are talking about DO NOT EXIST for short positions  Only for options   So wtf are you talking about? How is this a DD with crazy upvotes?? Short positions can be held indefinitely as long as they pay the interest and maintain margin requirements set by the brokers / clearing houses that broker and clear their trades   Please dont read this post  Yes MOASS as a concept is a real thing but to think there is one that is imminent anymore for GameStop is an absolute FANTASY  The short interest is less than 50% of GMEs float  It is not 140% anymore   On top of this based on the volume and obvious dips it's clear that HFs are running this GME ship selling tons of OTM options to retail dreamers and playing both sides by buying up shares as well as selling shares short at highly established positions   Sure diamond hand some expendible GME shares but don't fuck around with money you can't afford to lose please folks    Not financial advice make your own decisions  I can't stand to read these same MOASS posts for another month as they continue to string people along",2021-03-18 02:35:57.864344

Float is number of shares available to trade  Like sitting in people's or funds brokerage accounts  Sometimes they are leant out to short sellers or MM's wanting to hedge  Shares that are not considered in the float cannot be traded easily  Think of non-float shares as stock certificates sitting in a bank vault  This generally doesn't change on a day to day basis much if at all   Volume describes the number of shares traded in a given time period  If I say today's volume was 10M that means 10M shares traded hands during the day ,2021-03-18 02:36:34.808679

See these high price targets always fail to mention how difficult it will be to maintain momentum with higher price targets retail will be priced out and large institutions dont want to take on as much risk  Like 1000 a share will price out so many retail traders  And make it so much more difficult to maintain volume  And shorting then becomes much more lucrative and easier as the downside opens up so much more   I just feel like so many people are missing the practical aspects of achieving this crazy high price targets like 10000 a share  I think 1000 is very realistic but once you start going past that? Option liquidity will dry up stock liquidity will dry up and shorting will become easier  A bunch of people will also paper hand once it gets into the 1000s which alleviates buying pressure more   I just want someone to explain how these types of projections manifest rather than purely speculating using mathematical analysis  It just creates more confirmation bias and blind hope rather than an empirical backing ,2021-03-18 02:37:11.416739

Shorting costs money which they may not have much of at this point there aren't a huge amount of shares to borrow against and the low volume recently means liquidity is drying up  So any price movements downwards like happened last week will be met with equal or more than likely greater force upwards as it becomes cheaper to buy shares  A short attack is possible but it might be a huge final mistake as it acts as a slingshot    especially if it's true that there are long whales in the water who have just as much or more money to throw at this than short funds do ,2021-03-18 02:37:27.688327

I'll reiterate again  The fears of interest rates rising in the short to medium term have been put to rest as of yesterday's Fed announcement  It was basically one of the best possible outcomes given he laid out the 2023 timeline   This isn't a squeeze play for me its a value play and I see it moving up to the low teens in the next few weeks as the market sees that  Fantastic income gorgeous balance sheet with little debt and a nice dividend to boot  Yesterday I found value in the stock under 8 50 only but with the fed announcement anything under 9 50 right now is easy money    I like the stock ,2021-03-18 02:38:09.296019

Very bullish today and the baseline is $10 so it's still a smart buy  The news about them making their brokers pick them or Rocket and their report about not hitting their mark for how many signed the deal didn't slow it down at all and honestly it must have helped  The movement today brought a lot of calls ITM and if it pops to 10 or jesus 11 by friday that is a lot of calls that need covered  Then they are listing on the Russel index on friday  These factors highly indicate strong buying pressure all through next week  And like I said they are below their baseline  700 @ 8 65,2021-03-18 02:38:14.988297

Can I just ask why anyone listens to this guy?  His target demographic is women sorry but statistics ok I'm not tryna be sexist but kinda am being sexist I ges idk man leave me alone who think that if they start acting like him then they will be rich   They genuinely believe the reason that they aren't rich yet is fear of the stock market   My finance teacher for example talks exactly like meetkevin the finance guy from YouTube   Fake southern accent bad jokes the whole deal  Oh and yes I am technically underage but due to the lovely joint bank account thing I am allowed to make trades so no I shall not leave the casino as I am technically only guiding my parents in buying stocks ,2021-03-18 02:39:12.151408

I agree with this  Totally up to each and everyone of us  But it’s become obvious even just being in this group for a handful of months that the demographic has changed  It went from a bunch of people who understood this very well to a bunch of people who don’t get it at all  They come here asking for someone to give them sound financial reasoning on GME  If you’re asking that question in this group on a stock like GME then you’re taking risks you have no concept of  And I wouldn’t care at all except that it’s people throwing away their savings and assistance checks that they most likely need in hopes of getting rich  But it takes sheer dumb luck to get rich day trading if you’re at the level where you need to make these kinds of posts ,2021-03-18 02:39:19.260607

They got rid of a boatload of debt by diluting shareholders  And it’s not the first time they’ve done that in the past couple years    Sure they avoid interest payments but shareholders literally paid for the debt by holding  As a company they won’t go bankrupt in the short term but it doesn’t help their fundamental case all that much  They were in heavy debt before Covid happened  They robbed peter to pay paul,2021-03-18 02:39:29.610888

That is why I think it’s only a small possibility that brokers freeze selling  It would cause a legal shitstorm and class action lawsuits  Plus what you have said about investor’s trust is absolutely true it’s paramount to maintain that trust in the markets otherwise the whole thing gets screwed   I believe GME holders will see a nice payday but final selling price will likely be determined by brokers or government intervention,2021-03-18 02:39:53.366122

Questrade is delayed by 15 too on the main holdings/account page    but when you go to sell/buy the stock its got a refresh button that is realtime and then counts seconds up since your last refresh      My technique i guess is to do a sell order for what i would be happy to get and then if it doesnt clear as fast as i want i modify it to the ask price   A couple cents a share isnt worth sweating over when its 1800    But ya market sell just opena you up to citadel using your shares to cover their losses ,2021-03-18 02:39:56.771044

I can’t believe I’ve been reading this and the comments for close to 30 mins now   All signs are just pointing towards tendies    The question is - how unrealistic is it to really expect this thing to fly to 6 figures like ppl are guessing?

Mm no no    This is in NO way on the people buying GME  This is because of the HFs and their unchecked tactics that spun out of control  This is not on us whatsoever    You say manipulation is fucked but its okay because it creates a volatile market? You make 500% a day? Dang    There will still be plenty of opportunity to swing trade  Essentially every single private security out there is acting as it should and your career choice will be just fine  There will be some red days so pull out and sit on your cash    You're welcome for the opportunity to know what is about to happen and then the opportunity to also be able to buy back into things low once the dust has settled and make those great gains again ,2021-03-18 02:41:02.380378

This resonates well  Keeping the price sideways while buying up as many calls between $220 and $280 is going to be the all around cheapest way to create a gamma squeeze for this week  Next week it might be different prices  But keeping the price stable for another day marginally lowers iv which lowers the cost of the options which then creates a more desirable buy price Friday morning to prime a solid gamma squeeze ,2021-03-18 02:41:30.908277

First of all  >	This is one of the things I call a fraud stop and yes I DID come up with the term its just easier for my brain ok?  Imagine if a doctor discussing a brain hemorrhage with another doctor and called it a “brain ouchie” just because it was easier on their brain    dude you don’t just make up words when discussing something so specific    Regarding your naked shorting scenario: dude what the fuck are you talking about? You been reading too much GME conspiracy fantasy? Naked shorting is illegal  You can’t naked short as a retail investor you don’t find a stock to short  You don’t talk to anyone  You don’t “borrow” you just put a short sell order if your broker says it’s available  That’s it  If it fills you’re not short  They’ll hold a ton of money on top of that as collateral and they will liquidate your short aka buy back the share if you get close to your collateral not being enough  I just checked if I short sell a single Tesla stock at $700 they reduce my buying power for $350 and they’ll close my short if Tesla hits $900  That’s how it works that’s how they don’t lose money   The stories you read is probably about actual professionals with access to much lower levels tools than you get from brokerages kinda like how hedge funds do  You can’t do these things you’re talking about on a brokerage open to public no matter how high your level is,2021-03-18 02:43:31.645318

DO NOT SELL YOUR SHARES TO TRANSFER OUT OF ROBINHOOD!!!  If you have to leave open a new account first  Link your bank account and deposit money  After the transfer is complete and you still think holding the shares you own on RH is unsafe review the new trading apps rules on account transfers   Personally I opened a TD Ameritrade account at the end of January  All my new funds go in there  I have 200 shares of GME and some cash to buy yummy dips  I am going to hold my shares of GME in Robinhood in case this rockets anytime soon  You will get your money!   Please don't listen to all the FUD  Do your own DD and think about your plan  If you set up an account transfer more likely than not it will take over a week to finalize longer if done midweek    Just keep holding your RH shares of GME open a new trading account transfer any extra money into it  DO NOT SELL YOUR SHARES   tdlr: bots and shills tryna get us to sell  Do not sell your shares  Hodl and open a new account ,2021-03-18 02:43:56.846221

"""Never lived through a period of Elevated inflation""?!  Dude The minimum wage hasn't been raised since 2009 and inflation increases on average 1 9% to 2 3% per year far out pacing increases in wages to essentially make it so that most of the 18 - 25 year olds don't have a chance of building wealth    Why attack a bunch of young people trying to find their financial strength when the system is stacked against them  What the fuck is this guy talking about?   These kids who ""don't want to talk about bonds or interest rates"" don't have to file taxes on income this year until next year anyway and this situation right now will be the greatest opportunity they will ever have to reshape the system  This isn't about just making tendies this is about reshaping a lopsided coercive financial system into something more fair and equitable    For us old timers who can see how much this exposes the unfair advantages that financial giants have had that we've seen for years and have been unable to do nothing about these kids found a way and it's not illegal to share information and make your own decisions based on good research   This guy needs to be cancelled ",2021-03-18 02:44:06.133163

Hi Alexis  Could you reiterate your thoughts on 'Gamification'? I felt they were a bit 'nanny' state-ish   From a personal evaluation of the situation the stock market is absolutely speculation - and that's the way it should remain  I understand the need for some regulation but what we actually need is more transparency and information - information in this day and age is the great leveler  Another leveler is constructing algorithms - but that's IP ,2021-03-18 02:44:08.986307

 RKT is only 40% above its all time low  NBD    PLTR is only 1 7x from its all time low which was at IPO time  They weren’t shorting back then  This won’t hurt them too much either    AMC is 7x from all time low  Yeah that’s gonna hurt a bit but they’ll survive    GME is over 50x from its all time low  This is the one that’s going to kill them   That’s why you see so much more fuckery in the GME chart while AMC just rides  GME is the one they need to suppress to stay alive ,2021-03-18 02:44:20.229157

Sorry for the long ass rant  I'm using this to walk myself through my thoughts   1  I hate myself for being a party pooper  But I spend 90% of my time going through the memes I gotta get my head back to reality    2  I've spent a lot of time now trying to find a source for the $60trillion insurance  Nobody can produce a source  Forgive me but I don't believe it at this point   3  Let's just pretend that it does come to that   a $60trillion payout  First that's more than the market cap of NYSE and NASDAQ combined  Nobody in the world has $60trillion for a policy payout  Liquid assets illiquid assets doesn't matter doesn't exist   4  Let's pretend somebody *does* have $60trillion to pay out  First problem inflation would probably come into play but that's not worth spending mental energy  Second problem is  If they do have that money it'd probably in illiquid assets  They'd have to sell $60trillion worth of assets to buy our GME shares  Who would possibly buy $60T worth of stuff? With $60T of assets the value and price of said assets would plummet nobody exists to buy   5  Let's pretend somebody *does* have $60T in assets and *did* sell them for $60T  They now give us that money  Their GME shares are now almost worthless maybe worth $200-$400 optimistically  GME holders have $60T in cash? More money than currently exists? There's inflation possibly again                   I can't even think what might happen next  Stock market would be worthless? We buy the shares of the general market? Who do we buy them from? Who owns them? This whole thing is truly an economic or financial singularity  My logic definitely goes wrong somewhere in this thought experiment    6  The real takeaway here is that it's not going to happen  Nobody is going to be paying out $60T  It's fun and entertaining to fantasize  But it is child-like naivety irrationally delusional cult-like to think anything like this will happen  It physically can't happen  And if it could government banks fucking NATO lol wouldn't let it happen   I do hope to hell we get the squeeze  It's fun to meme and fantasize but I don't like seeing stupid and oft-repeated false information spread  We gotta keep our wits ,2021-03-18 02:45:22.931664

The last two mornings we took a dip in the first half hour after open  I'm not saying I predict it again but maybe hold your horses for a few minutes and see if you can catch a fire sale  There is resistance somebody is playing against the rise so there will be dips throughout the day but it's nothing like GME  If today was an indicator they are fast and bounce back very quickly  I don' think the resistance was ready for this kind of volume  Don't just take my word on this  I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR ,2021-03-18 02:45:55.710989

IMO The upcoming events will not be a short spike but a long drawn-out affair   I do not think you'll get stuck holding shares you'll have time to act or continue to hold at your new investment house   There are no promises but this is where we all support each other through the stress   I have a lifetime of savings invested right now and even at the craziest numbers I only plan to sell a little   It's damn scary but I trust the the DD i've read and done     Keep aware of the situations and look for / follow actual press releases by R Cohen and team     You're going to stress just don't change your course based on stress without actual facts to warrant bailing   You got this ,2021-03-18 02:47:42.636305

Sell all your GME before it’s worthless and put your profits into Palantir  It’s a real company with actual long term upside  GME was a short squeeze that made anyone who got in early a ton of money if they sell before it crashes  It will crash  I feel terrible seeing people taking mortgages on their homes and buying GME at these current inflated rates  Take whatever you can and get out of GME while it’s still inflated from the recent madness  You don’t see bearish posts about GME because it’s honestly a joke and for people who can’t see the joke it’s on them ,2021-03-18 02:48:45.624259

Strongly disagree  YouTube is filled with videos of Tesla’s “failures” because A  there are only 600 waymos representing 6 million miles versus 1000000 Teslas representing *5 4 billion* miles *per year*  Tesla drives more miles each day than Waymo has driven EVER  That creates orders of magnitude more interactions including autopilot failures to fuel those compilations you watched  b  As others have mentioned Waymo works super well in a very limited scope  Put it in the same situations as Tesla and it’s autonomy disappears    Speaking of which Tesla’s computer vision and neural network will render LIDAR unnecessary  LIDAR is like training wheels on a bicycle: it makes you look like you are a great driver and terrible without it  But as with bicycling eventually you outgrow the need for it and you discover you can accomplish more without it   Finally Waymo reports a crash every ~333000 miles drive   Tesla autopilot reports a crash every 1 4 million miles driven    🏆 Tesla,2021-03-18 02:49:32.588847

I am not sure if this is the way  There was some DD on robinhood in the GME subreddit that looked at Robinhoods filings where they 3 billion collateral they had to post was basically because they were short on GME  In short buying shares on robinhood doens't effect the price action at all but selling does ,2021-03-18 02:50:25.353858
QUESTION: I have been using RH for a while but don't want to go through the trouble of switching brokers atm but when GME squeezes will RH be able to block any kind of selling when it's above a certain price??

You’d be at risk of assignment if you bought 100 shares and sold an ITM call yes  But you likely wouldn’t be assigned right away   Here’s how it works: there are two styles of options European and American that has nothing to do with where you buy them or where the company is  The main difference that you need to worry about is that European options can’t be exercised early but American ones can  DAL is an American style option unless I’m mistaken    So let’s say you do your plan: you buy 100 DAL and sell a $50 call  Whoever bought your call could if they wanted call their broker and exercise it  Their broker lets the clearinghouse know and the clearinghouse randomly picks someone to get exercised  Then that person’s broker deposit is the money to pay for the contract into the seller’s account and grabs the shares sends them back to the clearinghouse who gives it to the buyer’s broker who delivers to the buyer    For the most part the risk of getting early assigned is low  No one in their right mind would buy a $50 contract for $4 90 and then turn around and exercise it  One exception might be if there is an ex dividend date coming up then there might be a reason someone would exercise early though it would still be dumb to exercise an option you just bought — it’d cheaper to just buy the shares   There’s not really a catch  The only way you really lose is if the stock moves a lot against you you could miss out on gains on the top  Also if the stock were going down in value you couldn’t just sell your 100 shares  You’d need to account for the shares you’re short first in other words your broker isn’t going to let you be short 100 shares of DAL — you’d either need to close the contract or buy another call to leg into a spread ,2021-03-18 02:52:16.042404

Assuming this really occurs my guess is a freeze is put on the stock and then a few days later you will get an email from your broker asking what price you are willing to sell for     You’d be bidding blind not knowing what others are willing to take to sell   People who asked too high would be fucked when the stock reopened    I think before it gets to that point though Yellen hands out some IOUs to get major shareholders to loosen the $ROPE and sell some shares off market ,2021-03-18 02:53:24.431511

okay  the difference is I'm not making any positive claims  you are  that quote is an actual straw man     it's possible that a source becomes compromised sure     you should start questioning your process though when it starts to seem like you reject things based solely on preconceptions which is what you're doing here     your sole reason for believing that short interest isn't really 15% even though the same people who reported 140% say it is is that you think gme is going to skyrocket     you're working backwards  you're starting with your conclusion and throwing everything that doesn't fit it out without reason or evidence     i didn't downvote you  please actually read what I'm saying to you here ,2021-03-18 02:53:39.822143

It is the fault of the banks and the fed in the first place   The hedge funds are paying interest on huge sums of money that the banks are very happy to collect   That’s why they were allowed to massively over-over-leverage   The banks borrow money for free because of the fed policies   They are given that privilege b/c they are supposed to carry minimal risk   This is the problem with a 0% benchmark rate when the actual risk profile can never be low enough to justify that   The banks have to find synthetic mechanisms for making these bets and they have to make money on very slim margins   But they have essentially unbounded volume   So they think ok roughly infinity*0 0001=infinity   Where can you hide it?  In the tail of GME an over-simplified example being the selling of 800c contracts when you have the power to make sure they will never be exercised   The hedge funds are the guys the banks pay to get their hands dirty and take the fall   The banks guarantee that the hedgies will never see jail time or confiscation of personal assets   Have you heard Jamie Dimon speak?  Did you ever ask yourself how someone who is maybe slightly above average intelligence is worth billions?,2021-03-18 02:55:17.890667

GME probably worth $25-30 but I really don’t see AMC at a $13B market cap  Sure they may actually produce real earnings per share this year but that doesn’t get them out of the fundamental reason why they became debt leveraged in the first place    It’s incredibly expensive for them to expand at this point  Streaming services are more aggressive than they ever have been in providing brand new top tier content  On top of that there are better places to see a movie  Alamo Drafthouse is the shit catch me dead watching a movie anywhere else   This is one big dead cat bounce that could last a year  By 2024 AMC is going up to the heavens with blockbuster and RadioShack unless they completely transform their business and I don’t see how they can,2021-03-18 02:56:05.346907

No I'm basing it on the fact that gme is still over $200  Why would it still be that high if there wasn't still significant short interest? You're telling me retail is holding it up that high? No another hf is keeping it that high just for shits and giggles? The positive news alone is keeping it that high? I doubt all of those  The current value of GME has nothing to do with perception unless you're telling me my physical vision is actually that bad which could be true tbh,2021-03-18 02:58:00.577156

As I understand it a lot of that stuff goes back to things like fomo and repeatable human actions   a cup and handle may work because people see that it mooned twice original bag holders may get out when it moons the second time creating the handle  with the price dropping due to a lot of selling and then others wanna jump on because it’s a good price of course we are talking about stocks that haven’t been heavily “manipulated” or don’t have as much attention as gamestop so cup and handle may or may not work because a lot of people see the obvious pattern and thus u may have more people shorting it because they know people see the pattern  I guess u can really say it may go up or it may go down but for the love of go’s I hope it goes up cuz I really want tendies,2021-03-18 02:58:20.217822

Yeah you're right it's upon their agreement I just assumed that it's only his money and that maybe they have THEIR savings at some other place  But I am not sure about the last part - I don't think if it is a good idea to share investing plans to other people because they can influence our decision making especially wife  I think if he has a stable job then it's okay to use his savings  For me personally I would always want to have something for black hour but there are a lot of people who don't have any savings at all I believe ,2021-03-18 02:58:39.908502

This   Jealously guarding information is smart for big players  But to act on the same level as big players at that level we need to be able to work together to some degree  That doesn't mean market manipulation and telling other people what to buy but it *does* mean making clear what *you* think is a smart bet so that others who agree can join based on their own choices   Does this let the hedgies know what we're doing? Yes  It's also the only way we can let *each other* know what we're doing   For hedgies it's purely harmful to be open about their positions  For us it's a double edged sword and we have to decide whether it's more harmful to do so or more useful  I err on the side of useful ,2021-03-18 02:59:30.945437

Let's just hope that flying spaghetti monster doesn't come for you  The method is and has always been to try to kick the can down the road for others to deal with    but someone will be left holding the can or bag in this case   Maybe the problem is that enough people ignore these problems in the first place?   &#x200B;  Most likely things will just continue getting worse and worse    and more and more people will try to insulate themselves rather than addressing the underlying issuesas that is the MO and ignore the negatives  Everything looks amazing when you ignore the negatives unless you happen to be crushed by them and can't ignore them   Only time will tell what happens  One can always stop digging the hole and climb out    as long as the hole hasn't collapsed in on you before you had a chance   &#x200B;  The good news is simple: The US government can print up magic fairy dust until the cows come home  If they do this wisely they could do it to save themselves and maybe many others    but I have no faith in the government  They are really good at moving cans around     but what happens when the music stops?,2021-03-18 02:59:38.200495

Normally id agree but this situation is so far from normal  Conservative numbers show they'll have to buy the entire float many times over just to cover  Given that it frankly doesn't matter what retail does  Buy sell  Doesnt matter institutions could do it all on their own  Retail could likely do it all on their own too even if all institutions sold less sure about that due to reported numbers being from many different sources and inconsistent but it would be close at least from the numbers I've looked at ,2021-03-18 03:00:59.897500

I have been thinking about what would happen if when GME hits $1000 per share   I personally would be at $60000 profit and many others would be at a much higher number than that   The brokers would be responsible for paying us if we decided to withdraw our earnings right?  But what would happen if they didn't have enough liquidity?  Would they just go bankrupt?  I'm sure we couldn't actually make the hedge funds pay us since it's not really their responsibility   My main question is if all of us decide to cash out with huge profits who is going to pay us and how are they going to get the cash?

">No I'm basing it on the fact that gme is still over $200  Why would it still be that high if there wasn't still significant short interest?     short interest doesn't dictate the price of a stock  this is actual nonsense     >You're telling me retail is holding it up that high?    probably has a lot to do with it  usually people don't refuse to let go of essentially worthless shares     >No another hf is keeping it that high just for shits and giggles? The positive news alone is keeping it that high? I doubt all of those     okay? so you think it's just because everyone actually knows the TRUTH that short interest is actually 47473929% and a squeeze is inevitable? that's your theory? do you have literally any evidence whatsoever to back this up? you can't use the high price as ""evidence"" here because then you're making a circular argument ",2021-03-18 03:03:50.765902

"This is an interesting perspective on things   I too believe that the MOASS will occur but I don't think any of ""The Powers That Be"" TPTB will allow it   There is far too much fallout in letting it get out of control   Circuit breakers will kick in the NYSE will halt trading brokerages will disable everyone's ability to buy or sell primarily buy like last time and as you mentioned someone is going to be left holding a very heavy bag   If it's Retail investors the financial media and Cramer types will say ""See!?  We told you so!"" and bash WSB and ""meme stocks"" and we'll all be left holding our dicks   If the billionaire hedge funds get left holding the bag they'll get a big fat bailout and the Retail investment crowd will probably get investigated again at least the major players like DFV and the rules will change to prevent this from every happening again   The squeeze has to happen unless they change the rules which is unlikely but I can't imagine it getting any bigger than 5x what it is now   We'll see   TL:DR - Short squeeze coming just not into the tens of thousands ",2021-03-18 03:08:02.431964

official inflation numbers will be low but everything you pay for each month food rent bills etc will be very high  as with all economic numbers the government just fudges that shit to whatever number they want you want high gdp? just print money lol  want low inflation? just change the inflation calculation to whatever you want  as an investor you can't beat these fuks at this game  the nice thing about this fed is they are very transparent all they give a shit about is stocks and they will not make any moves that will upset the stock market,2021-03-18 03:08:10.758938

DTCC is not the savior I trust them to act in their best interests however and try to save themselves to survive  Citadel isnt all of the DTCC either they share with other big fish that won't take too kindly to be putting at such crazy amounts of risk  Sure they could just be using these moves to further cover up what they've been doing by showing they found no wrong doing but that's just even more kicking the can down the road and at this point aint gonna help them  Also I don't think they can enact governmental change fast enough to make FTD a non starter as that would be the level of change they'd have to force to make all their problems go away  Lastly the DTCC can pay up without going bankrupt  Not citadel ofc they'd be fucked but the DTCC would be fine as long as they cut this off soon ,2021-03-18 03:11:29.002299

The orig post is talking about the 10 calls  Max pain is at 9 and the 9 calls at that time had a 33 delta meaning that at expiry they'll have a roughly 1/3 chance of being in the money  The fact that it hit 9 today means very little other than now it's more like 50/50 chance that the 9s will be in the money  The 10s are at about a 25 delta now a 1 in 4 chance roughly  The max pain idea is that option writers will work hard to make sure the 10s don't print   Based on this I wouldn't buy the 9s or the 10s ,2021-03-18 03:11:47.274939

I think part of the toxicity is that so many more people are YOLOing their entire portfolio into GME as to it becomes a near $ROPE or Lambo situation   Then you have those not vested in GME that are sick of all the GME posts and then you have the HF bots   Only gamble with what you're willing to lose   I'm still holding my GME because this is a once-in-a-lifetime event but it's only 50% of my portfolio   The rest of it is in other failed WSB DDs such as RKT PLTR BB MT JDST/JNUG and betting against the mouse   Also keep in mind this place exploded from 1 5 million to 9 6 million    And the Mods Ape bless their souls have kept this place together like MacGuyver builds an ICBM   Duct Tape and Memes   Yet even with all this?

I agree a 401k is more flexible in trying to out perform inflation and less risky in terms of potential bankruptcy  However most pension plans are insured so even if the company did go bankrupt people would still get most if not all of their pension payouts  Additionally the rate at which most employers contribute toward pensions is much higher than what they contribute to 401ks  Most employers will match 401ks at 2-3% at most I’ve seen 4 5-5%  While most pensions will contribute between 5-14%  Which means those with pensions are generally setup with much more potential income at retirement age compared to those with 401ks    For the most part pensions out perform inflation by several percentage points yearly  From 2015-2020 pensions rose at an average of 7 4% a year while inflation grew at 1 53%  Which also doesn’t factor in the annuities that most people who get pensions have ,2021-03-18 03:12:39.240979

Short squeezes and gamma squeezes often occur in tandem but are fundamentally different phenomena  In short:  Short squeezes are when an individual or groups of individual are short a stock and the price rises enough such that they must cover in order to contain losses  The covering process can drive the price up in the process   A gamma squeeze happens when a stock rises enough such that the net delta of call options and put options rises to the point where the market maker who wrote these option contracts must purchase the underlying security to maintain delta neutrality  The process of purchasing the underlying trigger a virtuous cycle of 1  Increasing stock price -> 2  increasing net delta -> 3  MM must purchase more as hedge which -> goto 1  &#x200B;  What we have been seeing with GME is a combination of gamma and short squeezes ,2021-03-18 03:12:53.024075

with Gamestop it's already evident what can be done; take a look at Gamefly it's still a thing   Gamestop needs to either be bought out by them or by them and make gaming easier     Digital games are the way of the future since downloading makes things easier and takes up less hardware on one's shelf granted I'm one of those people who likes shelving since my and my wive's cats like tall places     At the same time personalities on youtube and other sites can praise a game for all it's worth saying it's the next hot thing when in reality it's not   that's why I like Gamefly you can test it out and if it's worth it   For me if I am not impressed by a game within an hour or so of play time then I don't care about it and it's marked off my list    The only way that AMC could be better is by buying a streaming service similar to what the Syfy blastr site has or IMDB and re-invent itself with streaming   Charge less then what any of the other streaming giants are currently charging   Currently; AMC does have a streaming app but it's not well built    They do that they fix it and make it marketable they could remain relevant for about another decade or so   They have the movie pass and the stubs pass; charge 20-30 dollars a year 30 for Movie pass which is a free hall pass essentially for movies and 20 for Stubs which is the same but you get points for movies you watch   Re-work them as programs   Stubs would be remain same price 20 or so for a year you can watch movies streaming but because it's a lower price paid you can't watch day of movie coming out you have to wait 24 hours and then you can watch it   Movie Pass charge 30 or so per year and you can see any movie at any time even older movies from times past or their metropolitan opera stuff they do on occasion plus their specials like anime one night only's and things of that nature ,2021-03-18 03:13:40.702814

Thank you  I truly feel like everybody hyping this up are people who are salty that they missed out on the actual squeeze and they want to believe that they have a second chance to get rich  Notice how nobody likes to mention what happened in January or that the short interest went down dramatically  They're pretending as if it's 3 months ago and this is a brand new opportunity  This whole GME thing is going to be a huge disappointment ,2021-03-18 03:13:47.530582

Selling covered calls is very low risk    Say I buy gme at $200  I sell a $300 covered call for $20 I collect $2000 cash    If gme goes to $180  I still have my 100 shares and I didn’t lose any money because I made $2000 selling the calls    If gme goes to $290  I still have my 100 shares AND I got a free $2000    If gme happens to go above $300  I am forced to sell my 100 shares for $300 each  So I make 50% profit and I still get to keep the $2000 I got earlier ,2021-03-18 03:15:32.402317

I get that they both showed signs of a squeeze before trading was halted back in January but I am curious if anyone has data showing the possibility of another squeeze for amc! Gme seems to have an increasing chance to squeeze even bigger but for the rest of us apes that are still holding amc I am curious as to the possibility of amc squeezing again! To me it seems like a lot of movement in the stock and basically a mirror image of gme! So my thoughts are if gme squeezes again than amc will do the same! And with the theaters opening up than that is also adding pressure to the hedge funds to settle there short positions! Does anyone have anything to add or am I the only one thinking the same way?!,2021-03-18 03:16:17.083761

First it's exercise  Secondly the dipshits buying these options are ultimately wasting the capital to buy the shares  Remember you don't just get to have them they have to be bought  For the believers if you're going to blow 50k or whatever amount just buy shares especially if you don't fucking know how options work ,2021-03-18 03:17:56.744401

Wow a goldmine of information on the mechanics of the market which I have been so curious about  Thanks for the extensive list of references as well  I’ll need more time for a deep dive but I am particularly interested in the potential for abuse in these off-exchange trades  As a CS research scientist I have been looking at exploring SIT’s SHIFT simulator to analyze the impact of retail trades on price and crash mechanics using historical tick-by-tick order book data but am now wondering if that would be pointless given the amount of internalizing  I presume that is not modeled in SHIFT and there is zero visibility into what is really going on  Thoughts?,2021-03-18 03:18:24.005681
