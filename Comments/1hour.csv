Very well where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery  My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet  My father would womanize he would drink he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark  Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament  My childhood was typical summers in Rangoon luge lessons  In the spring we'd make meat helmets  When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds pretty standard really  At the age of 12 I received my first scribe  At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles       There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum it's breathtaking I suggest you try it ,2021-03-16 00:59:30.131917

White flight was usually reactionary  In the case of my small town the black neighborhoods were “company towns ” Little better than sharecropping  Industry built the neighborhood so folk could walk to work then the company took rent out of they paycheck   Fast forward 100 years- whites have retreated to the country where it’s nice and black folk are 3 generations later still living there dying of rare cancers children have rare birth defects and everyone has asthma or asbestosis- never having lived or worked in asbestos    GUH  Trying to fix it is a losing battle  The problem is too big   It’s so fucking painful  I’m hoping after beating my head against this problem for at least another few years I’ll have made a dent in it ,2021-03-16 01:00:07.345740

It's possible I usually avoid placing things to dates  Looking at the hourly or daily we've been sticking inside of an ascending megaphone pattern which is where my upper range of 403 comes from  Bottom limit is around 370 which would also break the trend line from 2018 2019 and 2020's corrections  I feel like we have enough momentum right now to hit 400 to 403 before we move to the downside  I honestly like to only commit to a play when it's obvious where it's going and if I can swing it day trade options to capture a slice of the move ,2021-03-16 01:00:33.615135

Making it cheaper right now is just helping GME shareholders drop more money into it to increase our gains in the future  I don't know what their HF's game plan was but that doesn't seem very smart to me    If they had let us hit a higher crescendo last week GME shares would have likely had a much greater fizzle out this week  Now instead it is a cheaper cost of entry and they have very likely enticed a bunch of new apes this week  These are people who wouldn't have bought in with us previously if price had remained higher  As these newly minted apes hit the scene they will hear from the rest of us who have paper-handed ourselves into regrettable losses and learned from it and they will wise up from our shareholder experience  Then we have more apes with diamond hands added to the ranks of GME shareholders  WINNER WINNER  I could be wrong thoughts?,2021-03-16 01:01:36.878262

I have a majority of my money in AMC my portfolio is roughly 60% AMC 40% GME and even I believe that the sudden 180 from the media of ‘it’s worth max 0 01’ to ‘AMC ROARS BACK’ is complete and utter bullshit to distract us from GME  It almost worked u hedgie prick fucks   And before any of u retards call me a shill I’m just a lurker found my old account to make this comment fuck off,2021-03-16 01:01:52.577767

Honestly instead of corporate handouts I would rather see our government paying for improvements in water power food and internet in poorer communities  It would create jobs to build up the infrastructure and the funds used to pay for the services would go back to the companies who are providing the services  Better to make them earn than to give out no strings attached handouts to corporations paying CEOs $1 million plus   Ape translation :Money for services from corporations and basic needs met for underprivileged Americans,2021-03-16 01:01:58.130053

Check out what it was trading at last week when $BA was around $250   The main thing Boeing stock lacked was volatility & now it's here   I personally believe these put options are severely underpriced & represent an amazing low cost / high risk / rocket return potential!  They went from 20 cents to 51 cents in roughly twenty minutes during this morning's drop to $264 33   Now consider what would happen if the media actually reported the updated court info I source and analysts stop upgrading!

"It seems like it was ""invented"" multiple times throughout time  Ancient Mesopotamians In \~2000BC Sumarian scribes used blank spaces to denote absences in number columns  The first recorded 0-like symbols is seen in third centaury BC in ancient Babylon as they used a base 60 number system  A similar symbols popped up in 350 AD when the Mayans marked calendars  Originally these symbols were used as placeholders not it's own number  It was only in 7th centaury AD in India where it gained it's importance as a value  By the 9th centaury AD 0 was adopted into the Arabic numeral system in the shape we see now   So yes and no   Fun Fact: 0 as a symbol only entered Europe in the 12th Centaury AD",2021-03-16 01:04:01.180918

My only issue with it is the volume  If you look back last time GME started crashing back down when the volume died down  I didn’t blink for a second last week when it crashed to 178 bc the volume was high and the dip got scooped right back up    Today there was very low volume and the stock I love so much nose dived  That’s what has me nervous,2021-03-16 01:04:14.321873

If today's downward movement was from paper handed retards it would've been more gradual  If it was a whale trying to unwind their GME position they'd want to do it in smaller chunks in order to make as big a profit as possible  A massive amount of selling without regard for the price definitely looks more like a short attack trying to shake out paper hands than anything else   Look back at today's chart  From open to about 11:04am GME traded sideways and by 11:18am it had dropped from appx  $270 to $226 in 14 MINUTES  As volatile as GME is that seems like a pretty clear and concerted effort to push the price down hard and fast and only people that want that are shortie bitches ,2021-03-16 01:07:08.107582

Me personally   I’d sell one exercise one hold the last one  Either way you’re taking profit loading a position and averaging down and by saving the last one you’re still holding your seat at the table  However that’s still contingent on how much you paid for them and what your break even is  You do you but shares is what’s going to pay off more in the long term for GME,2021-03-16 01:08:25.922656

Tanning is a fortunate side affect of this wonder drug but the regulators would never have given approval for a tanning drug  So the company had to choose a proof of concept indication EPP a rare disease where patients are in pain from being in the sun  This arguably gave it the best chance of being accepted by the regulators as there was no other effective alternative treatment  But there’s so much more to this drug than meets the eye  Regarding tanning they will be releasing topicals which contains fragments of the active peptide  This will be available over the counter and will be priced under $100 a bottle easily  These will induce tanning or photoprotection which helps fight the war against melanoma and other skin cancers  The peptide is also known to repair DNA by extension this will largely prevent skin cancer from developing  This is a huge market especially where anti-aging is concerned so the dermocosmetic market will be a target and is currently valued at approx  $15-25 billion annual and rising  But this is only one small aspect of what the company can achieve  The medical applications for this drug are profound  with one example being a trial is set to begin in stroke patients to help improve recovery in the penumbra site of the insult in the brain  Further there is speculation about a 6th indication being neurotrophic-oriented which could be multiple sclerosis or dementia  Either one of these indications if approved will make the company a $100 stock  This is baked up by the addressable markets Clinuvel has spoken about in their recent Strategic Update document available on their website  There is a Clinuvel forum called Sharetease that has lots of research and information  The sad thing about people’s initial reaction is they don’t realise what this company will achieve long term they only think of the tan  But actually this peptide is essentially a miracle drug which acts an immune modulator repairs DNA strengthens the vascular system etc  In recent studies the peptide was shown to reduce amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s while another study showed rats with induced cardiac arrest had a 70% increase in survivability when administer the peptide  The world dosent understand this drug yet but it has the potential to become one of the most well known drugs  Also because it’s a analogue copy of a naturally occuring peptide in the body it doesn’t have side affects like with steroids and other similar drugs ,2021-03-16 01:09:28.969291

Yep  I had about $500k  Rode GME up to about $1 5M then rode it back down to about $300k    I was day trading swings and selling CC's then sinking any gains back into GME shares to lower my cost basis  That backfired when GME surged and my shares got called away so I started buying calls and rode the GME rocket back up    I'm theta gang now  Trying to play it safe but make a few more percent before April 15 ,2021-03-16 01:10:44.112501

GME was on here long before you jumped on    And I didn't think it was impossible at all  I was making rips off the volatility  Unfortunately I got a series of stuff going on in my real life that I didn't pop out of one of my rips so I could sell when it got high  I even told my friend I was buying more at 45 an hour beforehand  I did sell some when it went up over 200 but unfortunately I can't on the rest   And guesstimate what when this crashes again I will buy more and still do rips because it will spike again because of folks like you  Except the peak will be lower again  I'll liquidate on that one and buy in at bottom again but probably nominal shares at that point and let them sit  I think a third pump and dump will happen before the morons catch on or run out of money ,2021-03-16 01:12:43.660060

So    Some shell company/ hidden slush fund of theirs or some of their friends with lots and lots of money had to create a bank and get it certified within one year so it could lend them money ,2021-03-16 01:12:49.031222

Look into APHA-TLRY merger  If you buy apha now you get a discount  You can either sell it before the merger if you like the gains or you can let it ride long after the merger  Tilray will be the largest weed company in the world  If you're scared throw in only a bit and see how you feel about it  Good move to get back in as the only real thing that could fuck with this is if the merge doesn't happen which has a very very slim chance of happening,2021-03-16 01:12:55.167078

This is a good point  In order to help fuel the spikes you'll need to be actively watching and submit buy orders when you see volume spiking  It's also worth pointing out that the shorts can run the price up intentionally to set a trap before attacking it to cause a panic sale  They've done this several times already ,2021-03-16 01:13:28.146526

"Good job getting indignant for no reason whatsoever   Or were you trying to say that you think non-English speakers aren't capable of using a spellcheker?   Because that's the only way your attitude makes any sense    The majority of people who speak English as a second language are better at spelling than native speakers because they actually try and more often use their spellchecker when they're not sure of something    I literally just said ""*That being said spellcheckers don't correct misused idioms so I think it's still worth making such corrections gently since they're a learning opportunity  People can't help not knowing something if they're never informed *""  So since they have access to the same technology as the rest of us and given that I just told you it's better to gently inform people of errors that a spellchecker doesn't catch could you please try to explain exactly what part of any of this is prejudiced against people who speak English as a second language?

I bought into GME shortly before the RH freeze  I didn’t get the worst of it but I did end up down something like 60-70% idk I stopped watching  Bought some more on the way back up to lower my average   Still green after today’s shenanigans   What I’m really saying is you should have doubled down on the dip  I bought in on AMC at 14 50 and lowered my average to 11 50 last week   The real question you have to ask yourself now is: “how much can I afford to lose?”  You want to go for a ride? Cause there’s a good chance you can sell for a decent % profit  I can’t guarantee that this is called betting for a reason   Me I’m holding long  If there’s a rocket or even a rocket test to the stratosphere I want to be on it   I’m also holding a personal belief that stock is worth more or rather WILL BE once restrictions lift especially with the new deals they’ve signed that helps make them more competitive to streaming which people are totally over after lockup for over a year   I believe the repressed socialization aspect of theater going is leading to a huge boom in the theater business so to me it seems like it will have greater value in a few months regardless of other market movements going on right now,2021-03-16 01:15:45.791294

It's nice to see something different than the usual echo chamber bs every day    My opinion though  with how expensive ITM calls are just buy shares  If you buy an ITM call they will hedge what 50 shares? I have not looked but are those calls much cheaper than 50 shares? Just buy what the call would cost in shares and achieve the same thing with less risk    139@85 00 ,2021-03-16 01:16:24.626650

If there are multiple days of 1-3 millions shares fail to deliver if last time is any indication should be several days of modest gains followed by giant leap  I would assume any day like today is one where there will be significant FTD 1-3 million  I would imagine they will try and push the reckoning past this Friday as so many on this sub have staked a lot on it if they do next week is going to be bonkers  And we get to check price movement against FTD to prove our thesis and buy more as they push price down  This is easy money ,2021-03-16 01:16:27.971744

I figured I would think they would look to create an online platform   unfortunately the biggest advantage of them is they could sell a product that works exactly the same as brand new for less price because it was used   What do they do in the digital age?

It's hard to say how likely the squeeze actually is because it depends on short interest which is never going to be publicly reported accurately on this stock  I personally feel like the short interest is still much higher than reported and a squeeze will happen   There are catalysts that could cause volume which I feel is what we have to wait for  Because people are no longer buying many shares something needs to excite people so they will  Friday is going to be a weird day because of the quadruple witching day and the 23rd is earnings  Best case scenario is we get an announcement of some sort during the earings call ,2021-03-16 01:16:50.568766

As far as I can tell you can't really lose anymore money than you initially put into it though right?  I mean your call is either going to be worthless or worth very little or worth a lot or something in between   But I don't know how you can lose enormous cash this way     I'm a retard though so maybe there's something I'm missing   There was a guy last week who said something about selling a call contract  which meant he either owed the person he sold it to 100 shares or 25000 dollars    but that seems like something besides just buying a call option ,2021-03-16 01:18:34.987134

It's highly unlikely that the strike price of $510 would be met the next week when that option contract expires   I mean just today GME had to be halted due to massive sell-offs Today's bell opened at around $270 and closed at around $220   Good luck for him to reach the target of $510 next week I just don't see it happening   It was a great play for him as a rich man's lottery ticket I mean it isn't technically impossible for the price to reach $510 and getting that option contract ITM before it expires   I am sure the price could eventually reach $510 but I don't think it's going to happen next week ,2021-03-16 01:19:30.343922

"I dunno my feelings on name changes is kinda mixed    Only examples I can come up with is the world of music    When an established band changes their name after several years ""in the business"" so to speak there's a lot of misinformation about the new band  Some people who don't do a bit of research just lump them in with ""another new band "" Still merchandising and branding is always tough on name changes which is why short of a completely different style and sound renaming shouldn't be done       Personally I thought Metallica should have changed band names after the Black album due to not only a drastic style and sound change but a seeming unwillingness to write music for over 20 years that would be even remotely considered ""metal "" My opinion only    Don't get mad!      In BlackBerry's case it might be intriguing to some to see what this company USED to do versus what it does now  The core of BlackBerry is somewhat the same; the phone market USED to be a huge part of what they did but it wasn't ALWAYS their only function    Just like G E  doesn't ""just make lightbulbs and washing machines"" my own early idiotic ideology about what G E  was all about ""back in the day"" many companies realize that having all your eggs in one basket generally tends to see drastic losses on the worst of days        But it depends on the industry    Fuck I'm philosophizing again   ",2021-03-16 01:20:07.314076

Hey I work in the gaming industry and I just don't see gamestop surviving long term       Converting to a streaming/online model is expensive and time consuming and even there the margins aren't great  Paying for CDN bandwidth and storage isn't cheap  Maintaining a steam like launcher isnt easy       Most AAA game shops aren't going to give up 10% to a streaming gamestop we're going to make our own launchers      They may very well eek some workable model and hold on for a few more years but there's no evidence they're worth the 14 billion valuation the stock currently sits at       Just because a bunch of retail folks pumped up a stock to a ridiculous price doesn't change the reality of the retail marker or what places like amazon have done to them    What the hedge funds did to try to short them out of business was a dick move Im not for anything like that  But at the same time this stock price isn't sustainable unless every retail trader never sells and then what exactly where did that get you ,2021-03-16 01:22:07.045032

I know you guys are all excited to shit on Citadel and all  But most likely what they’re doing is loading up on cheap money now before bond prices spike    My guess is that they think that bond markets are going to spike in reaction to the massive amount of money printing we’ve been doing  It makes A TON of sense to grab cheap fixed rate money now if inflation is going to explode    This is the same reason it’s great to own a fixed rate mortgage during periods of high inflation    In the 70s the fed funds rate hit something ridiculous like 15%  If this happens again they stand to make a ton of fucking money  And if not? The percentage rate on the bond is so low it’s a pretty minimal risk ,2021-03-16 01:22:40.193787

If an entity would give you money at an interest rate you believed you could grow faster than why wouldn’t you?  I don’t think this is any sign they’re underwater ,2021-03-16 01:22:48.935262
For example if you buy 10 shares at $250/share you spend $2500 for 10 shares  The next day if the price of those shares increases to $300/share you still have 10 shares it’s just that they’re worth more  The average daily volume over the last 2 weeks is 48 million / day so it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to make an impact on the liquidity of that stock unless you have massive amounts of money   Does day trading and ending the day with the same number of shares count as “holding”? In your own perspective you’ll just have to pay short term tax rates on your gains  If you hold for more than 1 year you’re taxed less  By trading away and rebuying several times a day as you see the price curve go up and down you are not effectively holding for tax purposes ,2021-03-16 01:22:48.935358

That's correct if you spend $500 on a call option the most you can lose is $500  The problem is a lot of people will only have $500 to their name and will bet it all on a call option then hold too long and then wonder why their account is showing a balance of $0 when time decay completely destroyed the value of their 800 00 strike GME options that expire tomorrow    : At least with owning shares you won't lose 100% of your investment unless the company literally goes out of business which is possible but much less likely ,2021-03-16 01:26:24.524077

Just one thing  If you sell an option to close you are actually closing the contract   The parties buying it are the same parties that sold it to you so they ate simultaneously buying to close  Thr contract is literally gone with no more obligation to buy or sell shares to hedge  It is removed from open interest once closed which is the reason OI can go down before expiration ,2021-03-16 01:26:26.790470

It's a simple conclusion  They currently operate in a state with 1 1 dispensaries per 100k people while legal states are over 10 per 100k  In addition to more competition for customers they will face competition *within their store* for the first time    Currently they ONLY sell Trulieve products  What happens when vertical integration is removed and stores are free and encouraged to carry an array of brands? They could realistically lose over 50% of the shelf space within their own stores and that percentage is across all 70+ locations    There's also no reason to expect them to be welcomed with open arms into a legal market by the retail stores they will depend on to help move their 1 **million** sqft of grow space  It's easy to do when you own the majority of stores and sell your product exclusively  It's a lot harder to do in an open market ,2021-03-16 01:26:38.086920

Better for the lender maybe  Bonds are sold in this case by businesses to raise money  But there has to be an incentive for people to buy them  The incentive is the interest paid on the principal or the yield expressed as a percent  Bonds can be resold and the up-front price of the bond can be adjusted to mess with the effective interest rate  Because $4 a year on a $98 bond is a better yield than the same $4 with a $100 ticket price instead  And when the bonds mature or expire you get the original first-sale ticket price back if you're the last one holding the bond and the bond seller didn't go bankrupt    So it's just a little silly that a shittier rating less likely to be paid; increased risk of bankruptcy bond is being sold with a worse yield than other bonds already on the market ,2021-03-16 01:28:21.434532

I'm by no means an expert so someone correct me if I'm wrong but I believe they have 21 days after shorting to make the cover  They're shorting millions more every week so it's almost inconceivable that they cover their positions because of day traders and paperhands but they're literally just praying that the hype dies down the stock value goes down and they can cover at a cheaper price  They are hemorrhaging money at a huge rate currently but they stand to lose much more if we just hold and wait for their timers to run out ,2021-03-16 01:28:58.228812

Buying calls/puts can can only lose what you put it  The difference being that you are very likely  around 75percent to lose it all  With shares in general they may tank but you aren't going to lose anywhere close to all of it  With options if the stock turns against you it's basically gone very quickly and if close to expiration there is basically no chance of recovery unless a massive move by the stock  Conversely if you buy them and then the stock rips you could quickly find yourself up 4-500 percent and even more  Because each contract represents 100 shares so it's highly leveraged   It's alot more complicated than that but you get the idea  If you buy an option just be ready to lose it all cause that's the most likely outcome ,2021-03-16 01:29:18.002174
BB is a good company on paper with a lot of potential  Their EV software has huge potential  But sadly BB got tied heavily into the meme stocks and it messed it up  The price was inflated for quite a while and bounced a lot because of it  It also continues to bounce  I thing it’s not a $11 stock yet but can get there and beyond  I would wait for dips as tech stocks drop they will and try to get shares at under $10  Anything in the $9 range feels too low for BB right now but it will get there again when people move out of tech as they panic over the market ,2021-03-16 01:29:20.510622

No one could've saw that hard dip and the halt on buying coming  The the amount of failing to deliver everyday for twelve consecutive days and reseting on the 13th day to avoid being forced to cover completely its honestly a completely liable play to keep holding   With the second some up of the stock and more people piling on everyday the squeeze looks like it'll happen more and more  The whole point of holding is to not give them a single stock to cover before it gets to a crazy number    Also of course I'm retarded have you not seen the sub we're on my man???

I’m sure that would be a good play as well but I believe Altria will do more than just sit on their Cronos investment especially with how lack luster Canadian Weed Cos have been in the US  Think they take the route of buying smaller established brands to have a huge variety similar to what they have with cigarettes currently  Not sure who here is into weed but if they bought into/just bought any big names like Russian Assassin Boys Runtz Cookies etc they fly  Personally I’d like to see them take a stake in CURLF over any others ,2021-03-16 01:30:50.724508

Publicity helps us find lost apes even if it's random meme based publicity it helps  Think how much Citadel and friends have been spending on buying the media  $300k on charity paints us in a better light doesn't it?

In December GME had 100%+ short interest AMC has 20% they can literally cover in less than a day it's not a short squeeze it's a short pump  It's a great short term play by any metric just riding the hype is an easy 50% gain if you got in below $10 but when you compare it's potential to GME you see it's not the same or anywhere close ,2021-03-16 01:34:43.937586

"I got out two thirds during premarket because it was money I can't afford to lose  Now I wish I had exited completely Cramer is the worst omen      The hedgies didn't get me down  The news didn't get me down  But seeing people yolo tens to hundreds of thousands on useless far-OTM 0DTE calls last week sure did  Wednesday a whale bought a mountain of $200 puts  Then a short ladder and simultaneously the MMs assisted the crazy drop automatically because delta recalc those puts meant they needed less shares held to hedge to neutral  All we needed was people to buy $200 calls to cancel those out and end the week at $340  And it didn't happen  Forbes even said as much and ironically I think *that* was the reverse psychology play      I'm holding on to hope with my remaining 10 shares but unless the PRC / Max Pain gets rebalanced I'm bailing out 9 of them at my cost basis if we see further decline  Retail doesn't have the coordination or capital to create momentum at these price levels  And hedge funds are psychos who don't feel emotion so time is on their side  If it moons to infinite I'll settle for just one ticket  If it consolidates at 40 or 100 again I'll buy back in with a lot more knowledge on how to leverage the MMs against the hedgies   We'd need to basically be a crowd sourced hedgefund to play at their level and win but that's illegal as ""market manipulation "" Since we can't do that our only hope is a whale to match all the unbalanced puts with calls and then to make up some upwards volume frontrunning the MMs being forced to rehedge buying shares  Fuck man I don't want a lambo  I just want an implant dentist  ![gif]emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_bad_man",2021-03-16 01:35:18.637812

"Yep! An Oct 18 expiration with a 30 00 strike on a stock that's currently $15/share would gain a ton of value if the stock shot up to $22 a month from today  Of course it depends on the stock too if it was a stock that only moves up pennies a day you won't make a lot but a more volatile stock like AMC or GME would make much more because of what's called ""implied volatility "" The higher the IV the more expensive the calls and the more profit you can make from them  But yeah you could sell the call a month later in your example and make a huge return if the stock was volatile enough like AMC for example  *not financial advice of course*",2021-03-16 01:37:51.502507

So for question 1 yes 92B is a high market cap and gaining 50% in a year putting them at 138B is a large increase but if you account for shifting P/Es due to growth it makes it very doable  It’s not just the legalization itself they need to take action to grow    This directly ties into why I believe this is a better investment than CRON  I believe Altria will do more than just sit on their Cronos investment especially with how lack luster Canadian Weed Cos have been in the US  Think they take the route of buying smaller established brands to have a huge variety similar to what they have with cigarettes currently  Not sure who here is into weed but if they bought into/just bought any big names like Russian Assassin Boys Runtz Cookies etc they fly  Personally I’d like to see them take a stake in CURLF over any others ,2021-03-16 01:38:00.735538

I don’t really get this comment  How do you know how much other money this person has saved? How do you he’s retiring? How do you know he’s not already negotiating with other companies? How do you know he’s not trying to switch careers because his last one made him miserable and he finally has some runway to do it?

GME HAS LONG TERM POTENTIAL   This isn't poker and we are revealing our cards   The HFs have been at this longer more resourced well-versed and better at this game     Basically the HFs have been fucking us sideways in the shadows and kicking dirt in our faces   Now we have power and are telling them exactly how we are going to fuck them   May not be today tomorrow or in a year   But each day they don't cover is each day they bleed $   So hold ,2021-03-16 01:43:19.592301

Your brokerage account on Robinhood or Webull or whatever you use is still a financial account in your name  So when you sell a stock and the funds enter your brokerage account the profit you made off the sale is considered capital gains and the loss you suffered is considered a loss that is tax deductible  The computer does all the calculations for you and in February of 2022 it will release a Form 1099B which will tell you everything you need to know for filing your 2021 taxes with respects to accounting for your stock trading   For your question about helping a HF buy GME stock well if an HF attempts to buy a share of GME and you sell a share of GME they might be the purchaser of your share so yes  But I don’t think Hedge funds are buying any shares of GME right now  The stock price is above $200 and an HF is assuming that it’s way overvalued  An HF would determine that the real value of that stock is closer to $20/share based on pre-spike values and inflation  Hedge funds look for cream of the crop low risk investments and GME is just super volatile right now so I don’t think GME is anywhere on their radar at the moment  If you’re going to invest your money don’t adjust your behavior on anything about hedge funds; rather invest in a company you understand and believe in  For example the company you work for  You know the company pretty well if you work there every day maybe you know when’s a good time to buy/sell and a basis for those decisions ,2021-03-16 01:43:30.945154
It's alright I'm new to this and in over my head too just been reading a lot  But yes it could be either of those things but I would assume out of my ass that the amount of volume circulating through the hedge funds as they cover and short more is greater than what retail is buying on average  Idrk,2021-03-16 01:43:30.945341

"If GME had hit $380 before the expiration date of 3/12 he would have the right to purchase 100 shares of GME at the price of $380 per share but not the obligation to buy them   In that case he would have the choice to ""exercise"" his contract   Exercising in this case means having the right to buy those shares at his strike price of $380   In order to be able to exercise the contract he would need $380 \* 100 shares = $38000 in order to be able to buy them   If he cannot afford to exercise meaning that he doesn't have enough money in order to purchase 100 shares at that face value then he can sell that options contract his rights to purchase these shares at $380 each time 100 shares in the open market   Note:  Each option contract is always for 100 shares   So when you buy 1 options contract you are indeed purchasing the right to buy 100 shares at your desired strike price   You will only have the rights to purchase these shares at your desires strike price IF your contract reaches its strike price BEFORE your chosen expiration date   IF that does not happen then the contract expires worthless you lose the amount of money you used in order to purchase the options contract ",2021-03-16 01:43:46.953626

It’s pretty obvious the hedges are trying to get the weaklings to paper hand  Look at the volume traded that drove the price down  No way that’s retail  If retail buys up as many available shares as they can at every opportunity especially tax returns and stimmies their short sells are going to be even more difficult to cover and they’ll go belly up tripling down on the same tires bet they’ve been hedging against GME for months now   You like the stock?

Ah so that's why the 19th has been hyped so much  Thank you very much for taking the time to respond to my original comment and provide answers  So does that mean hypothetically we may see a big squeeze on Friday? Or will that come into effect close of play on Friday meaning Monday would be the real date we'd care about? Also where does the money come from if it lands on Brokerages? I know 500k per share is a mean but hypothetically there has to be a max price that can be set for the stock as money is finite right?,2021-03-16 01:46:27.936105

Yes I created this account 41 days ago  I created this account the day Mark Cuban chatted with us 🦍  When I invested in gme in January it was out of fomo  I saw the price drop and my portfolio turn red for the first time in my life  I was panicking and didn’t understand what was going on But I held  I learned a lot from the Mark Cuban chat and I continued to follow wsb afterwards  I’ve learned everyday and continue to learn everyday about the current situation of GME stocks options shorts etc    I know firsthand how it is easy to panic when you see stock dip and I understand how a lot of new traders can have the same reaction  I’m trying to help other apes understand and educate them the best of my ability because the ONLY WAY WE GO TO THE MOON is if APES STRONG TOGETHER!   So while you continue to criticize all the newbies that joined Reddit and wsb I’ll continue to try to help my fellow apes as much as I can ,2021-03-16 01:49:01.374044

I cleared out of AMC today after reversing my trend from down 80% to up 20%   I sunk all into GME   Now sitting at 300 shares at $141 after starting GME at $343 with 30 shares   I have worked very hard to get this right   Now I rest and wait     My exit strategy is sell 50 shares at $800 to clear my investment and then  💎 ✋  through supernova 250 shares   If it goes crazy to $10000/share I will sell 150 shares and keep the other 100 shares through the split which will DEFINITELY happen if it gets that high     I am guessing 10-1 so that GME can raise money for the conversion and become the Amazon of tech and gaming   This is just me     no financial advice   Also I personally like peanut butter on my banana and am fascinated by my wife's boyfriend's girlfriend and kneel before her for wet golden love ,2021-03-16 01:53:32.847797

Anyone else feel like all the talk of 100k+ shares is counterproductive and pushing people out not drawing them in? I remember when people were excited about 1k as a possibility which IMO is possible and maybe even likely  Now we have expectations which are IMO insane people buying far OTM calls 1 week out and basically donating to “the enemy” etc  rather than focusing on holding shares and buying ITM/OTM calls   Worse there are probably many people who would buy in but they see crazy speculation like 100k+ shares and think “wow this is beyond retarded therefore the whole play is retarded ” If they saw people with managed expectations they might have more confidence  I get it the math says infinite gains are possible  Cool but I think at even 5-10% of that price the government and/or oligarchy will do whatever crazy asshole move is necessary to kill it  Maybe even declare everything we have done illegal and try to claw back money  Let’s focus and get GME to 300 500 1000 and then I’m happy to talk huge prices,2021-03-16 01:54:50.154405

Only scenario without a conspiracy that plays out IMO is they have AMC on the back burner for now  AMC had great volume today and GME volume was shit  Giant sell off on GME at 11:30am EST around that time and I think that triggered some AMC panic selling due to the past where they both tanked simultaneously ,2021-03-16 01:55:13.069039
