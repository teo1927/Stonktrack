I litterally told people to do their own DD and that i didnt know if they should transfer or not no FUD here  But yeah conspiracy theory because you cant say at the same time that in january the first squeeze was triggered by retail buying GME mostly on rh and that RH stopping retail from buying stopped the squeeze and now today that RH has absolutely no effect on the upward because they dont buy any of the shares you order on the open market ,2021-03-17 23:20:24.383667

Airlines and hotels made a lot of money off of business travelers pre-COVID  I was one of them for a long time  And these are the people who have brand loyalty points/miles and buy expensive tickets last minute    Virtually no business travel in the last year  Add to that the fact that a lot of companies have found ways to effectively “travel” virtually  Hell many are talking about keeping people remote and close office spaces let alone talking about sending people on planes    I would not bet on a full recovery to pre-COVID levels of travel demand even after vaccinations ,2021-03-17 23:20:36.404835

They stopped buying because they got margin called back then  They couldn't afford to pay out more people tha would've bought into the squeeze  If they actually bought your shares on the market then there would've been no incentive to stop buying because then the shorters would've had to pay for your shares not your broker ,2021-03-17 23:21:01.202844

I assume he is talking about selling a $150p with the hope of getting assigned because he said he hopes it gets filled   Also you guys may have missed a large point from OP the price falling in to the low to mid 100's would actually be beneficial at this point   At our current levels the strike prices become too far spread out too fast to build an effective gamma ramp also we want the MM's to derisk from all the strikes between say 150 and the current price   As they sell to maintain being delta neutral it sets up the scenario where they can be forced into buying pressure   All of this is much easier to achieve at a lower price point  I know it seems counter intuitive to want the price to fall but this is a game of chess not checkers ,2021-03-17 23:21:08.234995

I agree especially because 08 was kinda government fault since they guaranteed collateral for banks who gave out mortgages to high risk borrowers ie low credit scores with no confirmed income  The banks “failed” only in the sense that they tried to bite off more than they could handle by bundling the higher risk loans/mortgages ,2021-03-17 23:21:37.567383

With rkt I think you’re 100% right but if no shares and only options are bought the price doesn’t have to rise on the stock  I like RKT  I put in other replies not saying no one buy options but there is a correlation between low volume of shares high volume of options and price dropping which in my opinion not expressed in post will only lead to less chance of a high squeeze and a lot of people missing out on money or people buying 800c on gme for 3/12 that missed it gives hedge more ammo against us at least ,2021-03-17 23:23:15.263227

Maybe someone can correct me if I am wrong but I believe that the DTCC provides insurance for securities past a point where a Hedge going broke from not being able to cover a short  [https://www investopedia com/terms/d/dtcc asp]https://www investopedia com/terms/d/dtcc asp  Meaning that even if each share of Game Stop was like 100K obviously most countries would be broke from that let alone a hedge fund as the total loss from their shorts would be 2-3 Trillion but the money would still be paid out to GME holders at that price   As these hedges would have their entire assets liquidated and then the DTCC would cover any remaining money needed to be covered    I believe they would theoretically cover 10's of trillions of dollars  I am unsure as to what total amount would even cause the DTCC to not be able to cover perhaps someone more knowledgeable than me could elaborate ,2021-03-17 23:23:59.784741

Fyi there is no expiration on short shares as long as interest is paid the shares can sit outstanding forever as long as the owner doesn't recall them   So if your correct and a broker just made up imaginary shares and Melvin comes to them and says btw I can't afford to pay interest or buy your shares they will probably just figure out a back room deal to end the contract     Just saying I wouldn't expect these institutions to play by the rules and close positions properly ,2021-03-17 23:24:02.097369

I personally don’t believe they will halt selling just buying    But theoretically speaking if brokers did halt both sells and buys of GME that would lead to chaos that I can’t predict    Retail investors will probably try suing while brokers financial institutions and the government all scramble to figure out what’s going on during the time GME is completely frozen,2021-03-17 23:24:19.632619

What might happen is GME goes to maybe a $1000 and crashes down after being halted  Everyone invested will lose because they were expecting the squeeze but it will go unnoticed to everyones grandma because CNN will report on the stock that went from $4 to $1000 in 6 months and that's it  There will be 10 million angry apes on reddit but outside of here how many will know or care what really went on? If the media tells them trading had to be halted for xyz reason they'll gobble it up and go about their day as usual ,2021-03-17 23:25:42.879775

RH accounts default to margin accounts when they are created which enables features like instant deposit and instant buying power otherwise you would have to wait for your deposits to settle before you can use the money  I believe there used to be a way to request your account be changed to a cash account within the app but they took it out  At this point you have to contact RH and request them to change your account to a cash account  Even if you don’t enable margin trading within the settings if you never contacted them and requested for your account to be a cash account it is by default a margin account ,2021-03-17 23:25:50.898660

"*"" and those borrowed shares are already costing financial institutions serious money  ""*  not really the interest rate currently sits at 1% yearly so 1billion worth of game stop shorts would cost 10 million per year far less than you expect them to have to pay out     Even if it were 100 billion in gamestop shorts 5x the current market cap of gamestop thats a large amount of 1 billion per year interest but I think we can all agree that its unrealistic they shorted 600% and that again 1 billion would be way less than what they would have to pay out under your theory   *"" Well the simplified explanation is this  When this squeeze bleeds the financial institutions like Melvin capital for example it forces them to sell off their long term positions across the whole market or else they risk getting margin called  ""*  there is literally 0% chance the shorts are selling enough stocks to cover any margin calls to cause the entirety of the US market to have red days   First of all Melvin lost 50% of its value in January which was Idk $6-8 billion maybe?  They claimed to have a profit of 23% in February   If they were massively selling off positions in February it would have been hard to have a profit of 23% in February selling their long positions without Bernie Madoff levels of fabrication   *"" because I believe this current squeeze is mainly responsible for the market wide volatility we have witnessed these past 3 months  I just wanted to make this post to bring caution to retail traders ""*  first of all there is no current squeeze there were two minor gamma squeezes since the original short squeeze   The stock has traded sideways/declined since last Wednesday   in no way shape or form is gamestop large enough to affect the market as a whole  The market cap of gamestop at 36 billion or whatever the height it was end of January is small potatoes   Even at that peak it was like 50 times smaller than Apple and Amazon     *"" So Why did I type up this long ass post?""*   good question you shouldn't have   none of this is financial advice do whatever you want do it with your own information do it at random i dont care just dont listen to me ",2021-03-17 23:25:55.117515

At least degiro uses SEPA which is nearly instant  The interface is OK but not great   The biggest issue I have with most brokers is that their interface is just straight from the 80s and either has so many features and menus that you don't know what's what and also no good explanation or it dumbs it down so much that you simply don't even get those features at all    Why can't they just make an app that shows you the important information in a clean and concise way with hint buttons for extra information when you tap them and the more advanced functions hidden behind menus that you can turn on or off  It shouldn't be that hard ,2021-03-17 23:26:25.711736

I see a bit different  Its literally hit 700 about 5 or 6 times and got rejected  Its also having resistance from the baseline of Ichimoku and the bottom of the cloud  On top of that it is touching the mid line on bollinger and the rsi is 49    So I will say if this time is the time it breaks 700 and holds it is going to rocketship above 800  I jist dont know if that is now or if it needs to retrace a bit before reversal,2021-03-17 23:27:41.187052

The whole congressional meeting is nothing but a bunch of overpaid imbeciles pretending to care  I don't need a lecture about my finances or spending/investment habits just fuck off already   Now if what OP says is true in the sense that this will collapse the entire market worldwide the most concerning would be the payout: I am guessing if all the billionaires put together their worth and combined the pot including those top millionaires there will never be enough to cover? The theory out there is that the DTCC or whatever has trillions and even that might not be enough? And now risking possible further shutdowns with all brokers? Well guess what? America is very litigious with these things and I am sure someone will end up paying for everything   I am willing to risk what I have to find out because in the end I still feel like they have to comply  Otherwise everyone will lose complete faith in both the regulators government and wall street at a whole new level more than what they probably already do   I am not scared one bit and I am not going to back down  I am already mostly all in because again if shit happens then I am ready and willing to max out all my cards without paying them taking out more loans without paying and even file for bankruptcy if it came to it  Fuck them all!  If it collapses everything including the market then people should rebel and not pay their bills to make everything whole  I invested in the stock marker took the risk and no payout means no money for investments or bills and they can eat shit  I will simply forward all the bills to the brokers and wallstreet ,2021-03-17 23:28:52.097556

Like i said in another comment terrifying  And in my experience in a technical role often non technical people are the ones who have better social skills and are the ones who are promoted more and doing the hiring  And they do this based on    what?

no one knows anything for sure its more a matter of risk management    If the story is true: risk is maximum you potentially lose everything if you don't transfer   If you transfer and the story isn't true: you have risk ONLY if the squeeze begins peaks and fully ends before your transfer goes through  People are saying their transfers are marked for the 23rd which is likely the next big catalyst date the earnings report  I'm not sure what else will set it off before then    Since no one really knows if I had stock in RH I would transfer half now and half later  That way you are hedging both risks ,2021-03-17 23:30:44.627991

This is just speaking from my experience   I have 47 shares of GME in RH from February  Since then I’ve been only buying more shares in my fidelity account and waiting to see if the squeeze happens  Then I learned that whatever shares you have in RH are not actually shares- just IOUs  This causes any buying to not actually affect the market price no matter how minimal of a change it is- just when you sell   Yes I went into RH and took of instant settlements and turned off margin sharing which “protects me” from them loaning out my shares but also means I can’t trade until the money I deposit clears the bank instead of trading on margin credit from RH   Today I started the transfer to fidelity with the $75 charge BTW FUCK YOU RH because I’m comfortable with my fidelity position and at this point am willing to risk the suspension of the shares during the transfer and not deal with anymore fuckery from them for when the squeeze happens   Note: if you look at your trade confirmation from robinhood you will likely see “M” under your trades made which means they were traded on margin  After you transfer you may need to call fidelity to request those transferred shares to be changed to cash based shares otherwise your portfolio is going to be filled with partial and weird looking share amounts   TLDR; transfer your shares out of robinhood HODL fuck the system fuck Vlad fuck RH crooks diamond hands and a better life for all the little guys ❤️💎🙌🏼🚀,2021-03-17 23:31:05.397507

>t was rallying up to $400 the first time  It halted multiple times the second time and went from $340 to $180 in a matter of seconds  Do you really think the big players and SEC would not find all possible ways to shut it down if it's running towards $1000? $800? $600? As much as I want GME to go to $1000 I'm afraid S  Even at 1000  It just takes a 3 year old with a calculator to figure out that this is not as big of a deal as OP and all the apes here think it is going to be  The price is where it is now 100% based on the speculation of the dumbest of retail  Why do you think there is so much posts about diamond handing and hold strong? What happens when dumb money stops holding and sells? Exactly  This isn't even a debatable point   Smart money wouldn't touch this shit and even the max pain you can inflict on a few HF's will not crash the market as you are implying  Do you guys even know how insignificant the market cap of GME is? Or even 100X the market cap of GME? Come on   ,2021-03-17 23:31:48.770532

That's with **cash**  The trick is to simply *not withdraw cash*  With Black Tuesday one of the biggest causals of such a deep depression after the market crash was people going out and pulling their money out of the bank until the banks literally could not give it to them   I'm not an analyst or anything but in the modern age we're in with electronic banking as long as people don't actually take out their money we ***should*** be fine emphasis on should  Instead of taking out cash you take that money and buy assets having direct withdrawals/writing checks     If you say buy a house that money is going right back to a bank some of which will be withdrawn as FIAT but most of which will be used for lending in other ways most likely more mortgages and car loans    However we're all apes and some apes here are going to still withdraw massive sums of cash to sit on which will end in the way you've described ,2021-03-17 23:32:00.865358

Depends on your brokerage but you can look at the options chain in WeBull and it shows you the current delta on each strike price   I don't know precisely how that factors in to how many shares MM would be holding  My understanding is at a delta of 0 7 they would hold 70% of the shares required to fulfill the contract  I don't think it's quite that simple but that is the basic concept   As implied volatility and price decrease so does delta and as delta decreases so should the amount of shares they're holding ,2021-03-17 23:33:29.547162

You're right that IV does play a factor but I believe you are thinking about it wrong IV influences the premium that the MM's collect to sell the call the higher the IV the higher the premium they collect thus giving them more wiggle room in their hedging   The risk of holding the shares is larger than the risk of delta hedging if the IV is sufficiently high   At least that is my perspective on it ,2021-03-17 23:33:29.547431

Right That's the same with Robin Hood but it's not instantly settled though you have instant access to your funds but regardless of platform it takes three to four days for money to settle when deposited  What happens during that time is that you can invest that money right away but you are transactions are synthetic essentially they don't count until your money settles at which point it does count  I think the question is does the buy action count after the money settles or do only the shares just become valid after your money settles I think the ladder would be how it works ,2021-03-17 23:34:03.974158

It certainly is fun to watch you play semantic games trying to escape the fact that selling covered calls is not bearish   Someone who was bearish wouldn't sell covered calls because they would be losing money on their long stock position it doesn't make any sense    You sound like someone that has read finance books but doesn't have any real-world experience with options ",2021-03-17 23:35:13.520537

"This theory is flawed and would be catastrophic for anyone long on GME  We absolutely DO NOT want the price to drop to $150 tomorrow  I'll explain why   As you mentioned all of the calls with strikes below $200 are already likely 90%+ hedged  They are presumed to be ITM by the time we close tomorrow so the MM's would be ludicrous to not have hedged these by now  As of now they don't have much gamma issues to worry about because the open interest on strike prices is pretty inadequate until we reach $300  This would require a tremendous push to get us there OR as you mentioned A MASSIVE INFLUX of unforeseen call options being rapidly purchased at every strike level from $210 all the way up to $300 tomorrow thus forcing MM's to hedge these newly opened calls  In any case this will be absurdly expensive due to the implied volatility currently scaring options traders away from the option chain   On the contrary if the price drops MM's will become less and less worried about any strike prices above the current trading price    For your argument's sake lets say the price does drop to $150  If this were to happen and even IF there was a bunch of call options purchased from $150 - $200 it would not do us any good  The MM's are not going to have to *re-hedge* calls that they have already hedged      which is what your argument somewhat presumes  Instead the newly purchased options expensive AF options would merely get us back to where we are now  That does not help us but only dissipates retail capital i e  it is counterproductive  Conversely the purchase of these call options from $150-$200 RIGHT NOW would have a far better impact because the MM's would immediately have to hedge since the calls are ITM  Thus increasing the price from the current value upwards towards the currently OTM calls not a whole lot until $300  Furthermore EVEN IF the price dropped to $150 these call options would not get much cheaper because of the volatility  To make things worse MM's could actually start dumping shares that they've already hedged on call options from $250-$300 or higher WHICH WOULD DRIVE THE PRICE DOWN EVEN MORE because it applies more downwards pressure on the stock PLUS it helps the MM's help themselves by allowing them to dump more hedged shares which are increasingly less likely to be ITM by the end of the day  This is what we want to avoid at all costs  This is what others mean when they say *a gamma squeeze can go both ways*    In conclusion your hypothesis that ""if we get down to around $150-160 before open on Friday it will take a significantly lower amount of capital and volume to trigger a large move"" is completely out of whack  This is actually the antithesis of what we need/want to happen on a options expiry date  To be blunt it would actually require MUCH MUCH MORE capital because the implied volatility has made the calls options so much more expensive then they were when people originally purchased those call options which are currently ITM  In essence what you consider a ""lower amount of capital"" would be much more beneficial if it was applied to OTM options at strike levels very close to the opening price tomorrow likely $215-$230; this would force MM's to start hedging right away increasing the price    Like you stated we DO NEED unexpected buying pressure to force MM's to hedge more shares  This does not happen when MM's are able to offload already hedged shares when the price suddenly dips  It works in the converse and allows them to help themselves by driving the price down even further since previous ITM calls are now becoming OTM right before closing   I appreciate your enthusiasm and effort to develop some bullish sentiment  But your DD piece is fatally flawed    All the best my brother   TL;DR: We do need unexpected buys but absolutely do not want any drastic spike on an options expiry date because it allows MM's to offload previously hedged shares as ITM options become OTM    Ape helps Ape  Ape still loves other Ape  Apes get smart together  Apes go to moon ",2021-03-17 23:35:23.001273
Wow that is a beautiful quote  To tell the truth I've never really thought of it that way  But it is so true  I lost my wife and daughter to a car accident several years ago  I was at Rock bottom when I met my current wife  I don't know what would of happened if I didn't have her and my new family  Some people aren't as blessed as me to find something to channel all that love in  It would have likely destroyed me   Man I love you apes ,2021-03-17 23:35:23.001764

You make a valid point and that’s one of the key factors that makes me question my own reading    I believe it’s very clear they have not closed their positions because the squeeze is happening again just like January    Retail investors have power to affect the market but they don’t have this kind of power to just pump GME into infinity this type of movement specifically requires heavy short interest to slingshot this price surge   So it’s very easy to believe the 140% float in January because it was confirmed ti Congress that GME was about to blow past 1k before RH halted buying   And now I don’t believe the current float because these current numbers don’t make sense off a 15% float ,2021-03-17 23:35:56.177988

"> That's something I didn't think about the tobacco companies but I have to wonder how many are still in the game tobacco companies that is  Most all places in the city of Atlanta itself have banned indoor smoking and places that still have ""smoking sections"" in the metro Atlanta area are very few and far between   There are really two major players in the game and both are desperately trying to minimize their involvement in the tobacco industry  The first is Altria formerly Phillip Morris ticker is MO and the second is British American Tobacco formerly RJ Reynolds ticker is BTI  They have been hedging their bets and are now finally entering the arena of weed  My take is that they got caught by surprise with how popular vaping became and don't want to repeat that mistake  They also want to get away from tobacco due to a huge downturn in sales endless lawsuits and a bleak economic future  In short tobacco is like the coal of the agricultural and consumer goods world    This is why both companies have been investing in the alcohol and cannabis sectors as they are still firmly in the vice category Stick with what you know but don't have the same stigma tobacco does  I think both companies are undervalued and will reap ***MASSIVE*** profits when weed is legalized  Hell they are helping it along since they have an entire lobbying machine they are throwing behind I suspect that's part of the reason there is renewed interest in Congress weed legalization  Not only will they see large growth but each company offers a very nice ~6% dividend that will ease the pain of YOLOing on tobacco stocks   > It's going to be an exciting day when or even IF Georgia legalizes weed completely    Personally after seeing what the weed market did for Colorado in my mind states would be stupid not to jump on this thing especially once they realize the massive economic gains  It's what Americans mostly WANT and many obviously recognize how stupid it is for federal laws to prohibit people from growing a fucking plant in the ground     Yeah I think the South stands to benefit the most from weed legalization and will see a lot of growth  I just hope they don't YOLO like they did on cotton and tobacco ",2021-03-17 23:36:13.743196

That type of bets isn't close to the wsb autists pre gme  Actual DD and atm/itm/ntm are legit but the FD ends in 2 days and the stock would have to climb 3 75x what it is currently for him to see a dime since theta decay strips all extrinsic value from it  Has there EVER been a time in gmes history that it has climbed 3 75x in 2 days? Even with the January spike that was 3x which is still a long way off  I've got a few shares of gme as a gamble but I really think the hype is over and the sharks are eating up all the otm options and laughing the entire time   If you want a squeeze then we need shares to drive up volume but instead people are buying way atm and giving the big players fuel to recover  I fully believe each daily dip is their way to short the fuck out of the stock and load up cheap calls and rinse and repeat  Every day it dips like clockwork and almost immediately rebounds  Isn't that a little odd? After they pulled the rug out from people the momentum died and now you have people fomo in and out constantly,2021-03-17 23:36:48.398217

Via u/manhattantransfer on the original post:  Most of the facts are correct but RH is not doing CFD    Citadel pays for all of their flow and when they receive an order from RH they can  * Pass it on to the market and pay take fees plus a bit of spread * put it on a dark pool and not pay take fees and possibly get better execution * hold on to it  and hope some other opposite side trader comes around etc   From RH's perspective they've bought / sold the stock    The real issue is that RH has bought the stock but not yet paid for it  The clearinghouse now has to loan RH money for 2 business days and they don't like to loan money on billions of dollars of hyper-volatile stocks because if RH blows up they are left holding the bag  Hence the margin calls   No CFD stuff going on here ,2021-03-17 23:37:10.774942

"I think the opposite; that this shows that people at the DTCC think that there is a chance that the lid will blow   As we know any failures to pay debts will fall upwards: from the brokers to the MMs to the DTCC and then maybe to the US Government and they not want to be holding all of ""the biggest bag of excrement eber assembled in the history of capitalism""   If that happens they want to be able to cut their losses at the earliest possible opportunity  This would let them do that   I am an alpaca and this does not constitute financial advice ",2021-03-17 23:38:29.961202

Dunno about everywhere else but here in Portland OR the house price explosion has been due to massive influxes of hedgie cash  They snap up all the available inventory at large percentages over asking price then rent the houses back to a bunch of former owners who sold without taking into account that there is NO inventory of houses on the market for them to buy and the money they realized from selling their houses is no longer enough to buy at the overinflated prices the hedgies caused  So now nobody is moving because it's a seller's market 100% but there's nowhere to move TO so it's a stalemate--I think that taking all that extra cash away from the hedgies will go a long way toward fixing this real estate stalemate and allow regular people to buy and sell houses at their actual proper valuation ,2021-03-17 23:39:16.867853

Just some info for people transferring to Fidelity and are worried about their shares being borrowed:  -	Fidelity accounts are cash by default unlike RH which are margin by default and you have to apply to enable margin  Meaning by default your shares will not be lent out  -	It seems to me you have to actually apply for your shares to be able to be lent out and they would pay you for it but you need to have at least $250k in your account to qualify  -	If you do choose to enable margin by applying for it you get the choice with every order whether you want to use cash or margin  Shares bought on margin are marked with an M next to them in your positions  -	By default when you enable margin on your account your shares will initially show as cash when you buy them but will be booked as margin when they settle  You must contact Fidelity to disable this feature if you don’t want them to be on margin but again if you don’t apply for your shares to be lent out they won’t be someone correct me if this is wrong   -	Some of the key reasons people are widely suggesting Fidelity: they did not restrict buying when the other brokerages did they do not lend out your shares by default and they have trillions in assets if they were to get margin called so they could cover it unlike RH  -	I’ve heard Vanguard is also a solid choice but I do not personally have an account with them so I can’t speak to how good they are but they also did not restrict trading  -	Yes Fidelity has a boomer UI that was put together before anyone heard of UX/UI and the app is lame  Personally I keep all my stocks and capital in Fidelity use Thinkorswim for charting/analysis and I still do use RH’s mobile app to check stocks on the go but I do not keep any money or stocks in it   -	Lastly only initiate a transfer if you are comfortable with the risk that your stocks may be frozen for a week  It is a risk but so is staying with RH so it’s up to you to decide which risk you are more willing to take ,2021-03-17 23:40:03.793206

I could be mistaken but my interpretation is that they have essentially stopped shorting into AMC any further and are slowly covering each day  Or at least didn’t short INTO the stimulus  They are no longer playing offense and have switched entirely to a defensive posture ,2021-03-17 23:40:13.345863

Because there's still plenty of time  I genuinely think the FUD being spread right now is coming from the side that says people should stay on RH  We knew RH was bad now we think they might screw you over even more  How is staying there not a bad move?  Full disclosure yes I would be happy if some paper-hands couldn't push the Sell button as easily as they did during the last few dips  But I also think it's in their own best interest   The squeeze will not be over this week  It will not even have reached its maximum next week  Now is the last chance to transfer ,2021-03-17 23:40:20.980669

so it is an interesting theory of the longs wanting to ramp up a gamma squeeze all of a sudden but the MM and the shorts wouldn't want that if they thought someone was trying to force a gamma squeeze   but it is all predicated on a larger short position than is currently reported and it is also predicated on short sellers and day traders not fighting to tank the price in addition to market makers ,2021-03-17 23:40:31.620938

I think it works differently on the sell side? When RH restricted buys it was because they could not meet the margin requirements due to the volatility  In other words the cash you put down to buy the share might have required some margin to actually get the share  When it comes to selling we are already providing our part of the bargin by offering the share  The hedgies not our broker is the one responsible to settle and provide the cash  So I would be very surprised if they restrict selling  Of course if the entire market goes to hell who knows what will happen then ,2021-03-17 23:42:33.573791

Absolutely,2021-03-17 23:45:56.087860
So it sounds like you either had a Robinhood Gold account and bought on margin so they sold some of your stocks to cover it  You could of had an options contract decline in value which you needed more collateral to cover or you made a deposit into your account bought something with the cash they gave you for it and then your deposit reversed  Which means since the funds were no longer backed up by your deposit they sold some of your assets go get their cash back   When you have a cash account you won't have any margin whatsoever  That means they won't be able to sell your stuff  The downside is that you won't be able to trade options anymore you'll have to wait 3 days to trade with cash from a sale and you'll have to wait like 5 daysweekends don't count  to be able to use money after making a deposit ,2021-03-17 23:45:56.088001

Increased demand in one sector followed by decreased production as a result of COVID regulations has resulted in the most miss match of demand and supply   This has caused a massive increase in prices  Because people have been focusing on minimum inventories and maximizing production there is no slack in the system to quickly catch up to the normal demand + the normal 3% increase in demand from normal consumption increases every year as we are still net positive on inflation growth   GDP is expected to expand 6+% this year near double normal GDP because of the pull back last year    It will take a full year plus before inventories are back to normal ,2021-03-17 23:46:08.426326

"From what I can tell the DTCC rule in effect as of the 16th is ""monthly reporting of your positions for us to check against our records"" was replaced by ""we're assuming our records are accurate and it's on you to check they're not on a daily basis  If we fuck up it's still your fault""   It puts the responsibility on the market participants to ensure the accuracy of the DTCC's tally for the day but since it sees all of the trades digitally anyway through it's various subsidiaries this is likely to be a formality but does also clear the way for the imminent SLD update from monthly deposits to daily and possibly intraday if someone gets too frisky ones   That's the fun one  DTCC sees fuckery going on with naked shares floating around in volume they just give the offending participants an hour to come up with the collateral  If they don't DTCC can just take it from their accounts/liquidate assets to cover it   I really don't think the DTCC wants to take the hit if something goes pop  Especially since to trade with the EU the NSCC now has to step in with it's own profits if a member defaults before they can start passing the buck onto collective collateral funds   I might've got these interpretations a bit wrong but that's the gist of them as far as I know ",2021-03-17 23:47:07.238856

"What will likely happen is that Gamestop will be called upon to split their shares or otherwise release enough shares to cover the short float at which point the short positions will have priority purchasing power enabling them to close out their short positions and stopping losses at great cost but staying somewhat alive   For if Gamestop refuses the results are going to be unresolvable   Another outcome could be a full halt on Gamestop trade or a manufactured credit rating drop both which depress prices in combination with a round of panic selling and Gamestop forced to release a round of shares to cover and clear the outstanding shorts as they find their shares basically useless   Lastly I suggest that the outstanding shorts could be rolled into an SEC supported buffer zone separate from the Gamestop short positions held with zero interest or otherwise frozen to be released back to original holders over time as the price of Gamestop stock stabilizes as retail and other investors liquidate their positions from the reduced demand on the actual shares   Do not assume that these people cannot/will not do anything ""off script"" to ""save the markets "" These options above or some combination is entirely more likely than a full moon situation and I would be preparing for them if I was in this risky bet   Remember: the rules don't apply when you can make up the rules  Good luck all   ",2021-03-17 23:48:05.303249

Is this because its not gme?  Or because you've done 0 DD on it and believe it because every other newb on this sub calls it trash because it's not gme?  If you would actually do any DD in it you can find a lot of bullish cases for this stonk ,2021-03-17 23:50:01.147083

If there are 10 million shares shorted and the average volume is 10 million shares then it would take a full average day of trading for shorts to cover    if average trading volume is 50 million then shorts can cover in 0 2 days   Generally it’s hard to squeeze with a low DTC because there is a lot of activity for shorts to sprinkle in their buys without it rocketing whereas a high DTC means a squeeze is much likelier to go nuts    Of course the general rules don’t apply to GME ,2021-03-17 23:50:24.113318
Dude preaching my word  If this were us they would be like “well you knew what you were doing  We need our money today or we will make your life hell”  Over A LOT less money  I was young and dumb and told an apartment complex I disagreed  with their withholding of a security deposit  My ass hit collections within 14 days  They needed money right then or they were going to bone my credit and go after my wages within the month  I know the rich have different rules but to pass the buck on me seems outlandish in principle  Yet who cares about that if you don’t have to  NOT OUR CIRCUS ,2021-03-17 23:50:24.113494
My understanding of what causes a gamma squeeze is that there are a certain % of call contracts that are naked that need to be covered before the delivery date   Surely the higher the better no matter what? It doesnt matter if we were at 150 then shot up to 215 or just stayed at 215 they still had the same volume of shares they could potentially have to deliver?

They have to buy a share or make one available for you to transfer  They cant keep them because the broker you are transferring to would demand the share   If they havent bought shares like the recent dd says it would force them to buy actual shares   The price increases last week after hours/pre market might be attributed to people leaving rh forcing them to buy shares instead of using shares from the dark pool - again as per the new dd ,2021-03-17 23:50:25.929187

Quick and probably stupid question; how in the heck can they freeze buying but not selling? How does that work? Because if you’re selling someone or something has to be buying and if that’s just other investors on other brokerages wouldn’t that bleed robinhood? Especially when everyone starts suing them?

T212    On the day of the first GME squeeze they blocked selling for a while as well as buying  Since then they've changed the app so you can't set stop limits of less than $100   There also seems to be another issue of sell orders going through after extended waiting periods and stop limits failing to trigger although these could be unrelated ,2021-03-17 23:51:21.769877

I use [this website]https://www optionsprofitcalculator com/ as a basic tool to figure out the total profitability based on past numbers  There's also [this website]https://optionstrat com/ which is a lot better as it gives you all of the greeks and % chance of your play working out  Buying calls closer to expiry is only more profitable because you're able to afford more  The closer to expiry the cheaper they are as the chances of it hitting the strike price goes down  For example a $9 call for 3/19 is only $43 but you only have 2 days for it to break $9 43 for it to be even at expiry  Your May/August calls have a higher break even price around $10 73-$11 20 but it's more likely to surpass those ,2021-03-17 23:52:42.878429

So I'm a little confused  So RH isn't actually bad to have if you're a small time investor right? Say under $50K? Because the issue is that your RH buys aren't actually effecting the market value of the stock which is a big deal if you're in this position for millions  But for small time guys you would still get your money if you sell so RH is basically fine for that reason if you were for some reason to sell? I'm *not* going to sell honestly probably ever lol but I just want to make sure I'm understanding the issue of why as a whole if a million people invest with RH it not driving the price/market ,2021-03-17 23:53:23.829937

Whatever  If this isn’t bullshit that trade is  Unless your worth $60MM liquid your fate is deserving   And if you are you won’t be for long with thinking that GME goes to $811 35  That government cheese isn’t coming to float this boat   Cash is king and will soon be the only king   Drop your stocks and grab your cocks because the Biden economy is just arriving ,2021-03-17 23:53:29.382207

This is quality due diligence  Would appreciate more of this for GME    Actually knowledgeable no questioning their own due diligence or making it out to be some conspiracy theory like story    u/AJDillionsMiddleLeg  Would you expect this to start after hours on Thursday or before market open on Friday? Would also like to see a follow up on this for you tomorrow if possible ,2021-03-17 23:53:39.533361

After reading through all this info my read is that the hedge bots are on the “keep your money in RH” side and spreading FUD about the squeeze being imminent to prevent apes from transferring but I know jack shit and apart from my 180 GME at 134 avg have lost about 2k from my account so follow your own instincts  And I’ve been using Fidelity thankfully ,2021-03-17 23:53:45.068994

I think there was two ways it could go the squeeze happens prices rockets everyone gets paid and few hedge funds explode or they use some underhanded tactic to stop the price from sky rocketing and drag this out but ultimately it going to squeeze at some point   Maybe the first scenario it was under estimated just how fucked the shorts were and therefore two was always going to happen but you have to prepared for both and as soon as you start making millions you get a lawyer as some cry baby rich fuck is going to try and get his money back ,2021-03-17 23:53:59.870596

A question burning a hole in this Ape's head:  We know that are multiple institutional long whales in this let's take Blackrock for example   We know they have a massive position in GME and have been known to be in cahoots with the  government for a long time  Let's we are approaching the GMEday and see a significant spike; $1000 for example    In the above scenario what's stopping the government from demanding GME dispose their position in the market sell in order to save the market from a gargantuan bomb and nation-wide economic meltdown ? In return of certain under the table favors guaranteed for Blackrock's future endeavors   I believe the government would this road which will give retail a semi-decent payout at the expense of HFs bankrupt them obviously  But save the system from an economic collapse    Thoughts ?,2021-03-17 23:54:26.821282

I mean squeeze or no squeeze the thing is minting all of us apes cash in day trades  Other than DFV and maybe a few others I think all initial investments have long since been scraped off the tops  Taking profits is not taboo that's what we are here for  What am I missing? My account looks fantastic I just don't get this negativity for the stock ,2021-03-17 23:55:07.534688
This is what I was thinking   Robinhood Sara only the middle men   They don't own the shares they aren't the issuers   They shut down because their issuer refused to issue any more gme shares   It is an interesting post   And the market does go down when gme goes up!

Long whales can get the price there fairly easily by dumping their shares against the bids  I'm not saying $150 specifically by the way just using it as an example   I also want to warn don't assume I'm right and take a diving price as a guaranteed good thing   This depends on long whales taking action Friday  And it also depends on that action succeeding   I don't even know for sure that this is the plan that's unfolding  Even if it is as with all plans it could blow up in their and our face ,2021-03-17 23:55:11.979274

You're on iOS?

And then it's time for mass legal action not against the funds but the individuals involved   Personally   Their fuckery will have caused documented harm to every retail ape and they need to be personally held liable     And what the brokerages should do is allow the sales but with the understanding that the cash isn't going to settle on T+2   It might be quite some time but that's a very different clock and failure to deliver quickly becomes securities fraud   That adds another round in the feedback loop of documented personal harm done to every individual holding GME etc     But it needs to be personal and everyone involved needs to spend the rest of his days living on only what Social Security pays out not owning anything more expensive than a toothbrush ,2021-03-17 23:55:15.660825

I’ve wondered about this  I’m sure we all have  And say it gets cleared up what’s ground 0  If twice as many shares are being held who owns what  Do we each keep half do some lose all while others lose none  Who pays how much debt and who gets how much gain    I’m just wondering how intervention plays out if that were to happen and even if everyone keeps theirs what happens to GameStop now that they have twice the shares without being the ones to release it  It brings a lot of interesting questions if they couldn’t foot their bills  Especially as well as being double fucked as everything else will take a beating too    I like the inverse correlation too  It’s honestly made a pretty great hedge with everything else I hold since this has happened  I’ve been unsure of the squeeze being allowed to happen it’s hard to count on that but in the mean time it’s helped with a lot of other red days ,2021-03-17 23:56:47.056767

Yes this argument is completely false  Worst case the money won’t enter your account until it settles 2 days   Not to mention OP seems to forget GME is a globally held stock  The US gov’t can’t just limit sell prices for the whole world  Debts must be paid ,2021-03-17 23:56:53.521145

This GME cult is getting weirder every day  Have you established a date that the world is going to end yet?  The squeeze already done squoze  The stock is up on FOMO and hype from new investors who have no idea what they're doing and HFs making a killing daytrading it  Melvin has been out for months  The inverse correlation you're pointing out is because daytraders are all hopping in GME on red days    Once the country opens back up and all of these new investors move on to the next shiny thing the stock will drift down and settle in the $40-50s  People already got rich on this you missed it  Look for the next ,2021-03-17 23:57:15.074142

Which should raise this question   Why should companies who are handling retirement portfolio's be allowed to dabble in the risky short game?  It's great when they win and profit off the investment dollars but how about losing?           They're allowed to take advantage of risky investments but the market shuts down when they start losing these risky investments   I don't give a cows ass about the retirement funds they're handling they shouldn't be participating in risky money management gambles ,2021-03-17 23:57:39.131743

Yeah that seems extremely unlikely   Maybe some hold out and see that amount or more who knows - but with something likely to be that hyperbolic whatever the apex reaches the extreme will be a small % of the overall in terms of shares sold at the extreme   No sense debating the numbers themselves   I fully expect it to be be a chaotic complete shitshow filled with constant upward and downward halts and turn into somewhat of a slot machine   TA news nothint matters at that point   Even if one were to time a sell perfectly at the apex execution is going to be a fucking disaster   I’ll just fire off one at a time on the way up and hopefully had thr patience to have shares left to ride it all the way up and back down again to make the most of it whatever the apex looks like   Off track here sorry but yeah bankrupting the dtcc aint happening   Causing some losses?  Sure   I think they expect it too otherwise they’d have left things as-is instead of changing the rules on collateral,2021-03-17 23:59:25.292566

"I would expect it to start either right at open or mid-day Friday  If it starts at any time Thursday it gives a longer window and lessens the ""abruptness"" of the hedging requirement   I also expect that the large players on the short side are doing everything they can to spoil the setup and will do everything they can to crush any momentum on Friday   It will be interesting to watch at least on the order tape  Price might go sideways the entire time for all we know lol ",2021-03-17 23:59:30.617556
Ah could be   You could be on to something   Another concern i have with all these apes is are we giving vlad more time to shop around for shares during the transfer period ?  We don't want to give that cocksucker any more of an advantage than he already has   My thought/TL;DR: transferring shares to another brokerage gives RH more time to shop around for spotty shares which they don't already own yet ,2021-03-17 23:59:31.237403

thats pretty sick $250K actually but would you have to prove that your stocks would have been worth at least $250K at time of selling? For example if the squeeze lasts 2 days but dropped off its peak would you be entitled to the peak GME price or could they argue you would of sold at a lower price point eg: when ur stocks were worth $50K instead,2021-03-17 23:59:41.375335

You are correct that the majority of construction unions still offer pensions  However in recent years many of them have been converting off the traditional pension model to 401k models  I have a number of friends in various trade unions who don’t have pension plans and instead only have 401ks  That said the unions still put up very generous 401k matching compared to most other 401k based businesses  And yes I’m aware they’re also eligible for annuities if they do have a pension    I was just making the comparison that more jobs in the boomer generation offered pensions not just union construction and gov’t jobs like it pretty much is today ,2021-03-18 00:01:16.767981

Being open and being profitable are two different things     Reduced capacity wearing a mask while watching a movie    It's still going to be a hard sell for a lot of people who could just sit at home in comfort watching a movie there   Hopefully in the coming months as vaccines become available to the general population and masks requirements are lifted then we will really start to see an influx in people going back to the movies     AMC is still a good long buy    People are definitely getting itchy to get out and enjoy things again      Personally if I can't go to the theater and be comfortable what's the point   I'm not going to go  That's just me  Most of these movies are going to have a very short wait before they hit streaming simply because they know the ticket sales aren't going to be like pre-covid and they have to boost sales numbers somehow ,2021-03-18 00:03:23.725696

I agree it’s confusing and the timing sucks but at least the info is out there now ,2021-03-18 00:04:16.217174
Watch stocks that are very volatile over days/weeks   Buy when they dip and wait until they're up to sell   Repeat   Don't focus on timing things perfectly you never will   Just take profit when you have it   Also it works better to have several going at once so you have to wait less to catch something that's up   Sell what's up one day and reinvest some of the money into what's down that day or wait till the next day if there are no deals   Small base hits add up over time ,2021-03-18 00:04:16.824104

Okay I don’t want to belabor the point that no one knows the answer but it seems like the people saying $10k a share are really exaggerating  I don’t understand the total amount of potential shit the HF are in and I think no one knows how many shares and naked shares exist?   I guess what I’m asking is that is there a likely threshold which is mathematically impossible based on the data we have    I’m not asking for a sell price but you see people talking jokingly about holding till 10k a share    There’s got to be some math to forecast this? I imagine the hf are using data analysis tools to figure out their pain point which is why they dumped shares at $350 to stop the run up    If that was their cutoff point does that mean that abode $350 a share would be too much money lost or is it likely they have tiers of money loss  Like $350 we lose a billion $500 we lose two-or are these guys as in the dark as we are since they also have no visibility into what the other houses are doing?,2021-03-18 00:04:17.936274

> So when you see 140% short percentage that doesn’t mean all available shares of GME were borrowed for shorting it means when these institutions Melvin heavily shorted GME the Market Makers Citadel created shares out of thin air and tethered them to the real shares that were borrowed   Is that true?  If GME had 1 share and person A owns it    let's say a person B comes along to short-sell the share  They borrow it from A and sell it to a person C  Now a person D comes along and wants to short GME so they borrow from person C and sell to person E   Now the short percentage is 200% right? And nobody naked shorted they played with a real share the only share in this instance    There is 1 share in float and 2 shares shorted   Please if anybody can correct me am monke let me know how I am wrong  I am 69% retarded it's a mix of nature and nurture to be fair and not a financial advisor ,2021-03-18 00:04:25.695135

I did read your post  You said absolutely nothing about them instantly selling shares  I stopped typing this reply and read it 6 more times and saw nothing about you saying they sell your shares instantly  If you are talking about the post from the GME subreddit then yes I read it and I still have a hard time believing someone who uses the words “I believe” in their thesis argument  Using the words “I believe” doesn’t make it fact but rather conveys that you have a “hunch” about something that you cannot confirm but are trying to convince people of    Secondly I have tirelessly tried to Google their annual statement find it on their website tried looking for it on the SEC website and I cannot find it  So if you could so enlighten me and send me a screenshot of where it says we don’t actually own shares of companies we buy in then that would be very helpful  Or at least a link to their annual statement  You could be the very first person I’ve asked to send me concrete evidence whom I’ve asked    Third your last sentence doesn’t make sense  If we don’t actually own shares of anything and it doesn’t affect the price then forcing people to sell like they did back in January shouldn’t affect the price because we don’t actually own those shares  Of course selling anything will make the price go down  You are right about that 100%  But if we don’t own the shares then it shouldn’t be having as big of an impact as it did correct?   Lastly if I didn’t actually own shares of any of the companies I bought in then why did Apple the company email me back in early January thanking me for investing in them and giving me the opportunity to vote who the next chairman’s etc  will be? And why did they let me vote on whether they should increase their quarterly dividend which I voted yes for? Why did this other company that I invested in last year send me Tax documents and thanked me for investing in them if I don’t actually own their shares? They wouldn’t know I existed if I didn’t actually own their shares ,2021-03-18 00:05:07.612686

Yes they sell their shares on the way down  Not all of them but in proportion to the reduced risk of that strike being ITM  If they don't they lose money as the stock price drops on the shares they're unnecessarily holding and need the price to go back up to not lose money  This is a form of risk which MMs do not take on voluntarily ,2021-03-18 00:08:28.753713

So the reason why I’ve not really discussed exact numbers in this post is because I have no damn clue what the final tally will be and its hard for anybody to find any numbers to speculate on plus I’m very skeptical of GME reaching 1k+ shares because brokers will certainly shut it down before or at least around that number    So even if the final price points is a zillion trillion quintillion dollars I don’t see it ever getting that close and I certainly don’t expect GME holders to see those type of gains even if they are entitled to them    I do expect GME holders to pull of the greatest short squeeze ever tho it’s just the final number that is the mystery,2021-03-18 00:10:19.787264

Just gonna hop in with a quick correction  Share price =\= market cap   In 2019 the market cap was consistently floating between $600-800m  Currently trading at $6 1B so in reality it was trading around $1 30 a $1 80/share when we account for the absurd dilution they’ve engaged in to stay afloat     in 2019 when business was booming fo everyone else,2021-03-18 00:10:44.149940

I feel the same way I wish I known a lot earlier how it actually worked rather than how you thought it was going to work   Like when NASA crashed the pod because it wasn't made clear to use metric or imperial units in programming  Yeah I can totally see that happen   Sometimes also feels like a bit heartbreaking reading optimism from seemingly younger people  Keeping faith in company x or y to perform on this level because they are a big company sometimes you know they don't understand how much happens based on random coincidences or how much hinges on one or two people that you'll never hear about that happens to be really really good at their job ,2021-03-18 00:12:30.185906

This may have already been asked but do you think the brokers have had discussions with the government about what they should do when this pops off again?  The situation is no secret anyone they just may not admit it publicly   So you'd think there'd be some guidance   otherwise they'll just play dumb I guess and brokers and govt wing it when the time comes  🤷‍♂️,2021-03-18 00:13:11.408546

Hey so my question is what will actually happen to retail investors if the squeeze finally DOES happen  Just picking an arbitrary number let's say mid April GME finally explodes and reaches $1000 $5000 per share or whatever ridiculously high number you want to pick  Obviously all of us retail investors will likely be rushing to sell off all of our shares right? Woulden't the brokers Robinhood Fidelity E-Trade etc  just HALT the selling/buying of GME during that time? Maybe a lucky handful of retail investors will be able to get their sell orders through but I can honestly see the majority of us having our orders halted or not going through/canceled  So what happens then? Do retail investors just keep their stock as the GME price falls back down? Do the one's who shorted the stock so heavily end up actually able to cover their shorts while us retail investors aren't even able to sell during the squeeze?   I feel like everyone things this is going to be some fairy-tale ending where all of us Sell all our GME shares when the price balloons up into the thousands but I honestly don't see that happening  I think a small handful of us might be able to sell of when that does happen but a lot of us will just get screwed by the brokers who will just halt everything when this does eventually happen    Thoughts?,2021-03-18 00:13:39.831081
Well that just doesn't correspond to the truth  😉  >You said go long tech just a day before a 20% correction  Oof  But this makes sense why you are emotional  And like I said  It’s okay I’ve lost money before too but you’ll make it back  Don’t take it out on your elders mr 1 year old account    It was Feb  22 when I wrote that nothing will change until at least 2022 and it is safe to go back into Tech  At this day NASDAQ closed at 13500 today NASDAQ closed at 13500  You see nothing has changed  Also NASDAQ only decreased 8 5% not 20% after Feb  22       >You said lockdowns were coming back in the next 3 weeks because of mutations  it’s exactly the opposite  States are opening up even california is now in their red tier  You couldn’t be more wrong    I never talked about lockdowns in 3 weeks you put that in my mouth  I was talking about increasing numbers within the next three weeks I agree with you here in the US vaccination is going better than I expected and the numbers have not gone up yet  I mentioned earlier how it looks in Europe  What protects the US from a similar scenario? 11 9% fully vaccinated and 21 7% who got the first shot? So I wouldn't be so sure that vaccinations are going smoothly  There's still a long way to go  If it wasn't for Biden I'm sure it wouldn't be that way     Go for the daily attention seeking hobbit I can do this all day  🤡👍,2021-03-18 00:13:39.831306

I have a tinfoil hat theory  Sell off of bonds accelerated in this quarter because of banks  Banks were selling treasuries because they wanted attention of the Fed regarding with the steepening yield curve  This was their way of saying: see if you don't extend the SLR exemption rule for us which you put in place last March we would need to dump the treasuries we have been holding which will technically cause a liquidity crunch  Now Fed is yet to make a decision on SLR exemption  The deadline is 31-Mar  They were asked about it today but they said JPOW said he plans to make a announcement soon but not today  Since a liquidity crunch would be a disaster for the economy at this point believe Fed would have no option but to extend the SLR exemption  Banks would then start buying the bonds and squeezing the shorts in the process  Fed will also get what they want i e  plunging long dated bond yields making sure easy liquidity   Not a financial advisor  But if the above turns true markets gonna moon left right center ,2021-03-18 00:13:52.553843

We're talking about the DTCC not the short hedge funds  If you don't think the DTCC not to even mention the long institutions care about the continued existence of and faith in our market you're out of your fucking mind  And it's not like the flip side is pocketing our money and walking away  It's a matter of losing small or losing big  Take a hit and your jobs and ability to fleece retail continues  Or refuse to take the hit and your ability to attract any more investment dollars disappears overnight  The DTCC manages trades for the biggest players on earth but aren't lining their own pockets the same way hedges are  You think they're gonna roll over for a couple dipshit hedge funds? You're delusional ,2021-03-18 00:14:26.496876

**Diamond-Handed APES**: We're dicks! We're reckless arrogant stupid dicks  And the non-GME holders are pussies  And Melvin is an asshole  Pussies don't like dicks because pussies get fucked by dicks  But dicks also fuck assholes — assholes who just want to shit on everything  Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way  But the only thing that can fuck an asshole is a dick with some balls  The problem with dicks is that sometimes they fuck too much or fuck when it isn't appropriate — and it takes a pussy to show them that  But sometimes pussies get so full of shit that they become assholes themselves    because pussies are only an inch and a half away from assholes  I don't know much in this crazy crazy world but I do know that if you don't let us fuck this asshole we're going to have our dicks and pussies all covered in shit!,2021-03-18 00:14:48.007898

Bought some 21yr Redbreast Irish whiskey with my tendies in honor of St  Patrick's   One of the best whiskies I've had  Better than Hibiki 21    Irish Whiskey is the fastest growing alcohol segment in the US  There is a new renaissance after decades of nothing  It is even outpacing Tequila/Mezcal and Bourbon consumption in terms of YOY growth  This is Mostly because there is a lot less restrictions on Irish Whiskey so more experimentation is going on while scotch has very strict guidelines to abide by   Calls on Irish Whiskey ,2021-03-18 00:15:25.021694

I appreciate this sentiment and the vulnerability  God knows Reddit isn’t always supportive of religious ideas    Even if there is no “afterlife” I do find some sort of comfort in knowing that we all kind of wind up in the same place  In some form we will all be reunited  Maybe not in a conscious way but it makes me think of a phrase that we say in my church on Ash Wednesday: “Remember oh mortal that you are dust and to dust you shall return ”   Even if we are just reunited as “dust” we all basically still return to the same place  Maybe that’s a weird way of thinking about it and I know for some people it’s super dark but honestly it gives me comfort    And fuck even if death is just — ya know death — and nothing else at least we won’t hurt so much anymore ,2021-03-18 00:16:55.273877

The chance of partaking and n the squeeze is greatly lessened by hanging on   Have you already forgotten what happened in late January?  Or are you confident that RH learned their lesson and won’t throw the brakes to save their ass again?  Transferring out is your best chance to make them deliver on the shares you rightfully own  This isn’t some diabolical 4D chess thing it’s very simple logic and past mistake/future adjustment ,2021-03-18 00:17:17.081973

Okay what do you make of this     I have a fraction of my GME shares on eToro  Checked in today and everyone is moaning that it keeps changing from market open/close several times per hour rendering it impossible to buy more  Angry word on the forums is it’s caused by an actual shortage of shares on the market due to the amount of us apes holding  Something stinks 🤔,2021-03-18 00:17:19.890433

maybe  I don't know much about this but reading from the [SIPC website]https://www sipc org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects it says:  > SIPC protection is limited  SIPC only protects the custody function of the broker dealer which means that SIPC works to restore to customers their securities and cash that are in their accounts when the brokerage firm liquidation begins   > SIPC does not protect against the decline in value of your securities  SIPC does not protect individuals who are sold worthless stocks and other securities  SIPC does not protect claims against a broker for bad investment advice or for recommending inappropriate investments   > It is important to recognize that SIPC protection is not the same as protection for your cash at a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured banking institution because SIPC does not protect the value of any security   > Investments in the stock market are subject to fluctuations in market value  SIPC was not created to protect these risks  That is why SIPC does not bail out investors when the value of their stocks bonds and other investment falls for any reason  Instead in a liquidation SIPC replaces the missing stocks and other securities when it is possible to do so   So if Robinhood never ***actually*** buys any stocks with your buy order but just gives you an IOU    its not clear that the IOU is covered by the SIPC since you didn't actually own the securities  Furthermore they don't give a fuck about making sure you get the VALUE of your stock they may just give you back the same number of stock AFTER the crash and you may lose all your money anyway ,2021-03-18 00:18:28.395297

I didn't end up selling but basically if long whales aren't fighting the price attacks and if GME isn't on SSR list tomorrow my concern is they'll attack the price more  On a deeper level I'm concerned if long whales are still with us -- the action last Friday and volume since last Wednesday seems to suggest they aren't  I can't think of many big catalysts except for earnings call which could go either way or Cohen CEO announcement and share recall which is also uncertain  I'm frankly surprised they haven't done a share recall already given all the fuckery that has gone done for a while now ,2021-03-18 00:18:45.907721
Lets ride! I’m actually still holding the 35c on 3/19 haha  I doubt it’ll hit but who knows   The day of earnings before release I picked up some 30c for 3/19 and those doubled up which was nice  I unloaded them Wednesday  It almost offset my loss on the 35s   I got some 40c for April too I’m down a little on them but not much   Overall I’m slightly down on the options but up a lot more on the stock so I can’t say it was a total waste   Tbh I should’ve gone farther out with the calls  Earnings aren’t the catalyst they used to be and for stocks of this volume few people read the call transcripts anyway  The regulatory news / changes are still completely ignored by the market and that was the whole point of the DD ,2021-03-18 00:18:47.032198

Gonna be honest long time diamond hand dude here still goi g to diamond hand  I would expect a hard drop between now and earnings report  If you look at the Wave Theory GME will bottom back out at $150 before shooting straight up   Why do I say this I think we won't see much price action between now and Friday  I think they will short this shit down to $170 area  People will get discouraged on Friday paper hands will sell driving price to a bottom of $150 price resistance   Following we will start to see a steady climb before we see a small spike probably between $350-$400  Before it goes nuclear and hits $2k a share and then possibily $10k  If you apply the Elliot Wave Theory $10k and higher is not a meme  The date for this is uncertain but the end result is inevitable due to the number is synthetic shares   Fact of the matter is I think we will see this crash down to $150 until it starts to climb up again ,2021-03-18 00:19:29.658331

Yes but there is a limit to how much you can contribute to TFSA per year  I think questrade put out a notification saying 2021 allows 6000 dollars into TFSA to do what you want    I am saying that if you put into TFSA before any rise in GME lets say you put in 1000$ into GME shares if you sell and it becomes 6000 profit NO TAX on that  If you buy it in margin 50% of capital gains gets tax   You can only put so much tendies into TFSA per year because there is a limit  Think there is TFSA contribution limit somewhere you can look up ,2021-03-18 00:20:01.715042

So I drank a lot and saved the highest alcohol content for last  It was the “kraken” - anyways so the waitress came over to take my glasses and pointed to one and said “are you all done with that?” And went to grab it so I just was like “oh I’ll finish it!” and grabbed it    So there was a *drop* in the glass  *everyone* was looking at me  So I just drank the drop and she goes “I asked because you never mess with someone’s alcohol” but really I just drank the drop because I already wasted her time  😐  Awkward ,2021-03-18 00:20:47.165801

The metric vs imperial thing makes perfect sense to me  I 100% understand how that happened  And it's a simple case of others' assuming the 'intelligent' people know what they're doing  And then they made a really simple and basic mistake   From my personal experience I've rarely seen any one person turn a company around  I can think of one specific example in my life where it happened so that restores my faith in humanity to a certain degree  But I ultimately know it's rare and for the most part the exception to the rule    Mostly in my experience it's the psychopaths and those willing to step on everyone else for their own gain who tend to rise to the top  And you're right that in reality it tends to come down to one or two people who are really good at their job that carry a lot of companies ,2021-03-18 00:20:59.767704

"They also apparently targeted people though it wasn't only ""irresponsible"" moves some of them were straight up preditory  NPR did an interview where a woman talked about it: https://www npr org/2021/02/17/968638759/sum-of-us-examines-the-hidden-cost-of-racism-for-everyone  *You write about the subprime lending practices in the 1990s that you know in some ways ultimately led to the 2008 financial crash  And there was a narrative here that you know these were subprime mortgages cheap mortgages being pushed on people who probably shouldn't be buying homes and these were irresponsible borrowers making bad decisions  You looked at this and found it's a pretty different story didn't you?  MCGHEE: That's right  In fact leading up to the crisis the majority of subprime and therefore more expensive loans were A going to people who had credit scores that would have enabled them to get prime or cheaper loans and B weren't for new homeowners  They were existing homeowners being aggressively marketed refinance loans that often ended up stripping equity and ending up in foreclosure  And the first targets for these kinds of toxic loans were Black homeowners   DAVIES: Right  You know I remember this  This was described as predatory lending by a lot of activists in the 1990s  And they asked the regulators you need to do something about this  What happened?  MCGHEE: The experience of being one of the ignored and unheeded and outmatched few who were trying to raise the alarm about this really forever shapes my understanding of economic policy  What happened was in many ways these regulators and these lenders there was a lot of greed right? People were making money hand over fist  If you could get someone to pay 9% on a six-figure loan versus 5% that basically doubles your money  That's huge but it was also a little bit of racism too - right? - this age-old stereotype about Black people being risky not being good with money  It's a tidy justification for denying Black people the opportunity to make money  And so it was a lot of greed obviously but it was also a lot of racism   DAVIES: A lot of these people are essentially hustled talked into these complicated mortgages  Many of them are foreclosed upon  And then of course the mortgages get bundled into these complicated securities that are sold on Wall Street one of the things that contributed to this huge crash in 2008 and of course the irony here is that a racially targeted marketing campaign which takes advantage of African American people  When the crash comes what's the effect on working and middle class white people*",2021-03-18 00:21:08.919254

This is the correct answer   But RH can and will cancel your transfer if you make any trades in your RH account during the transfer process   Also RH could potentially cancel the transfer and not provide a reason   However the transfer should complete if you are patient do not give RH any reason to cancel your transfer   I recommend you periodically follow-up with your new broker account regarding the transfer status RH per usual will not be available to provide you any information   Good luck!

I bought 100 shares at $50 in December it’s a good company with an AI based lending platform then doesn’t ding your credit  The price ran up to $105 last month it crashed way to hard  Two weeks ago Apple announced they were using them for future lending service  It fell further  When it hit $50 again I bought 100 more shares and started buying options  I DCA’d down to 2 41 a contract borrowing more moneypersonal loan after maxing out on margin to keep the play alive ,2021-03-18 00:21:11.126852

I responded to someone else in this thread but I'm going to post it again so you see it   Will the SIPC protect you? maybe  I don't know much about this but reading from the SIPC website it says:  >   SIPC protection is limited  SIPC only protects the custody function of the broker dealer which means that SIPC works to **restore to customers their securities** and cash that are in their accounts when the brokerage firm liquidation begins   >   SIPC **does not protect against the decline in value of your securities  SIPC does not protect individuals who are sold worthless stocks and other securities**  SIPC does not protect claims against a broker for bad investment advice or for recommending inappropriate investments   >   It is important to recognize that SIPC protection is **not the same as protection for your cash at a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured banking institution because SIPC does not protect the value of any security**    >  Investments in the stock market are subject to fluctuations in market value  SIPC was not created to protect these risks  That is why SIPC does not bail out investors when the value of their stocks bonds and other investment falls for any reason  Instead in a liquidation SIPC replaces the missing stocks and other securities when it is possible to do so   So if Robinhood never actually buys any stocks with your buy order but just gives you an IOU    its not clear that the IOU is covered by the SIPC since you didn't actually own the securities  Furthermore they don't give a fuck about making sure you get the VALUE of your stock they may just give you back the same number of stock AFTER the crash and you may lose all your money anyway ,2021-03-18 00:21:22.460545

Agreed   All that DD is talking about is how buying shares of GME on RH don't affect the stock price upwards and how they lend them to hedgies to use to drive the price down   You still paid for the shares and they HAVE to pay you when you hit the sell button    People are overreacting to this news and shills are helping push it   It's not worth the risk of having your shares tied up in a transfer while GME moons  They could intentionally delay transfers for a few weeks to prevent people from trading ,2021-03-18 00:22:19.008012

>Why do you think wealthy people often travel to the United States for surgery?  I live in Central Europe Hungary  the only surgery wealthy people travel to the US or anywhere abroad for is plastic surgery lol  Free healthcare does have its downsides but not mainly for the patients especially people who are actually sick and need more than an annual checkup  Aside from covid you can go to your doctor anytime for free go to an emergency room anytime for free and get whatever surgery you need anytime again for free  Virtually all medication is government-subsidized which means you pay like $10 for something that costs $3000   Hpowever it's expensive as fuck for the government and medical professionals earn a *lot* less than in the US as in barely lower-middle class for doctors basically poverty for nurses although they are raising wages now  Which means that many people with the means to do so leave the country to work mostly in Northern/Western Europe or to a lesser degree the US  Since education is free too this means that we are using our taxes to pay for people to get trained as doctors or nurses and then leave the country  :D They have to pay back their education's cost if they do but if they have western wages it's almost nothing ,2021-03-18 00:22:56.074325

There's only two Greeks that matter Delta and Theta  All the rest are just derivatives of those two literally that's how they're calculated  The reason the rest exist at all is that Delta and Theta become instantly outdated as soon as the price or time! moves and the derivatives give you a feeling for how quickly they change  Thing is all the rest change with price and time too so how valid are they really?  And then there's the elephant in the room IV  In reality none of the Greeks matter because they're all a function of IV and IV does whatever the fuck it wants  How convenient that the Greeks can be 100% wrong about what the price of an option is going to do not even get the *direction* of the move correct and that's perfectly fine for some reason because    IV did it    You can totally pick up some marginal benefit from *really* knowing the Greeks but their value is absolutely overstated ,2021-03-18 00:23:12.079687

My understanding of this and I'm open to correction was that the sell-side broker is on the hook not the buy-side so in the case of an entity like Citadel the responsibility would go from Citadel directly to the DTCC no broker  In the case of retail shorting sure the brokers would be on the hook for that and rightfully so - it is their job to be certain a stock can be borrowed before lending it out ,2021-03-18 00:23:16.604655

I think you click the button in the bottom right  Click investing and scroll all the way to the bottom  If you have a gold account you need to first click the gold dudebefore clicking investing and downgrade from that  I have a Gold account so I am unable to see the option for instant settlement but if I remember correctly it is there   Do you mean going from bank account 👉Robinhood or robinhood 👉 bank account?  Bank account👉 robinhood click button bottom right click transfers click transfer to robinhood  When you have a cash account this will take like 5 days until the deposit completes for you to access your money   For Robinhood👉bank account you first need money from sales to settleor if you are trying to withdraw money from you recently deposited the deposits need to complete Then you follow the steps above but click transfer to bank account  This also can take up to 5 days but it is sometimes faster,2021-03-18 00:23:32.030490

So if I’ve done my research correctly and I’m understanding what you’re saying then the only way out for these short sellers is to sell off their other stocks so they can pay their bill which makes the stock more valuable? And the short sellers bill is so high that either the government or some large entity is going to have to step in and bail them out? So it is only a good time to buy GME and hold out until this day inevitably comes? It must and will come! So when I get my ninja trader up and running you’re saying that GME will be a great first stock to buy  I hope I got this right ,2021-03-18 00:24:27.665144

copying what i wrote elsewhere  maybe  I don't know much about this but reading from the SIPC website it says:   >  SIPC protection is limited  SIPC only protects the custody function of the broker dealer which means that SIPC works to restore to customers their securities and cash that are in their accounts when the brokerage firm liquidation begins     > SIPC does not protect against the decline in value of your securities  SIPC does not protect individuals who are sold worthless stocks and other securities  SIPC does not protect claims against a broker for bad investment advice or for recommending inappropriate investments      > It is important to recognize that SIPC protection is not the same as protection for your cash at a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured banking institution because SIPC does not protect the value of any security     > Investments in the stock market are subject to fluctuations in market value  SIPC was not created to protect these risks  That is why SIPC does not bail out investors when the value of their stocks bonds and other investment falls for any reason  Instead in a liquidation SIPC replaces the missing stocks and other securities when it is possible to do so   So if Robinhood never actually buys any stocks with your buy order but just gives you an IOU    its not clear that the IOU is covered by the SIPC since you didn't actually own the securities    Furthermore even if IOUs count they don't give a fuck about making sure you get the VALUE of your stock they may just give you back the same number of stock AFTER the crash down to $40 and you may lose all your money anyway ,2021-03-18 00:25:53.361404

"Some of my thoughts  In regard to 2/24/2021 - I think this is about $SLGG as:  1  $GME is trying to get into the world of Esports and it's clear to see that based on their test stores   2  During the last earnings call for $SLGG Ann Hand said the following:  ""So if that retail partner is interested in pop-up Esports experiences or other types of entertainment I think that's another retail licensing subscription type model where we can offer them to pay some kind of toll gate or monthly fee to use our technology to drive more people into their venues  I like that  **That was always the original vision of the retail model was at some point we just really let the brick and mortar owner do the heavy lifting as far as marketing the event  They know their customer better than anyone ** Getting people there making sure it's a great experience not Super League doing it from afar and so I think with the vaccinations getting underway when we come back to retail we'll have a much cleaner model with a stronger margin profile""  You tell me what brick-and-mortar gaming retail store ""knows their customer better than anyone"" other than Gamestop    3  Ryan's previous tweet is a reference to the ""So you're telling me there's a chance"" scene from Dumb and Dumber  See [here]https://youtu be/nFTRwD85AQ4  Lloyd: ""What do you think the chances are of uh a guy like you and a girl like me    ending up together?""  Relationships = partnerships partnership with $SLGG?  On a side note I thought it was weird that he tweeted so much about Dumb and Dumber - I mean why that movie? If you google ""Dumb and Dumber March"" you come across this:  ""Just before Harry and Lloyd reach Colorado they stop a service station for fuel  While Harry flirts with an African American woman named Beth Lloyd uses the men's restroom  **In a stall he finds a message saying to be in the stall on March 25th at 2:15 A M  for manly love **""  Pretty weird huh? Very close to earnings too   P S  here's a fun fact - Penny in Dumb and Dumber To is played by Rachel **Melvin**",2021-03-18 00:26:26.995758

Goodies? Well it's not like they will compete with the giant Amazon       For me the gme squeeze as squoze  I hope I am wrong about it  want to see you on the moon but I am not realy bullish on GME   AMC is for me a 20> 30 $/share stock post covid people will crave diverstisiment    Tldr: down vote me I say gme bad,2021-03-18 00:27:40.228349

When the squeeze happens other brokerages will be pulling the same shit as RH did in January  Because they're all the same  Big money interests  None of them want to pay out   That and the sheer volume of people trying to sell when the squeeze happens is guaranteed to result in loading issues for some people   When the squeeze happens everything's getting nuked  And that's what this has always been about for me   If I can sell a share & some fractions on the way up to get my principal investment back I will  But I'm mainly in this to flip the apple cart ,2021-03-18 00:28:17.125957

Goodies? Well it's not like they will compete with the giant Amazon       For me the gme squeeze as squoze  I hope I am wrong about it  want to see you on the moon but I am not realy bullish on GME   AMC is for me a 20> 30 $/share stock post covid people will crave diverstisiment    Tldr: down vote me I say gme bad,2021-03-18 00:29:58.236910

There are counter measures for such things because society itself is akin to an amorphous creature courtesy of how interconnectedness works   Basically we will see a change of leadership structure and the basis for incentivizing profit generation   Long story short those businesses and business leaders who place health before wealth will get to be in charge as per the current will of the masses   It has always been like that except now speed of communication has struck the final blow for the needed change to be permanently implemented   In the past fickle communication prevented what you are seeing today   There is no us against them just WE maturing accordingly  💎🤲💎🦍💎🦧,2021-03-18 00:30:25.130709

This is mostly true but you are drawing the wrong conclusion    The market the government and the entire financial system is more important than GME or its holders  It doesn’t matter what is “right” or what is “fair”  All that matters is that they aren’t going to let the whole thing crash and burn just so some retards can double their lunch money    They will use every form of manipulation and power they have to get out of this situation  If you think Robinhood stopping GME buys was a scandal you will be shocked at what they can actually do  “Too big to fail” is a real thing and they will likely provide some sort of out for these institutions one way or another    In 2008 they let people lose their life savings they let people lose their jobs they let people lose their houses but they circled the wagons and protected the system  If you think they are gonna protect your tendies you are mistaken  Maybe Melvin Capital goes down like Lehman Brothers but they aren’t going to let the whole system collapse     The most likely scenario for how this all plays out is what you are already seeing  It’s a war of attrition  They have the time they have the resources and they have the support  They will draw this out as long as they can  They will manipulate the price to get people to sell  They will gradually unload their positions  People will lose interest people will sell to take profits people will follow the next meme stock people will sell to minimize loss and many will hold their bags until they are worthless     As you said GME doesn’t have much intrinsic value  It’s only a matter of time before it drops back to reality ,2021-03-18 00:31:15.304994

Well it would have the opposite effect for some  If the value drops enough that would trigger a massive buy from many  This would allow investors who are buying at various dips and amounts to average down in some cases and increase share holdings  Whether it's to increase the value of their selling power when a squeeze happens or just to stick it to the hedgies  A harsh dip only hurts this game of tug of war  I'm okay with it because I want to average down myself  But we will see what happens  This won't end well but it's a badge of pride to be part of it in some small capacity ,2021-03-18 00:32:36.058219

Everyone should check the PUT open interest for every big stock Apple was quite impressing or even SPY  It is suggesting that we will take a -25% hit  Also the call 800$ open interest for GME is about 44k  We are at all time high which suggest that profit could be insane to cover the fall  Look at yourself compare with the previous week this is crazy and scary ,2021-03-18 00:32:36.058544

Like I said I can't trade options so I can't give first hand advice  My opinion is that this is going to pop and then settle back down to a more fair market price than $8 a share  I've seen DD comparing their metrics to other stocks and pricing it around $18  But if we get the momentum it will go higher  My GTFO number is $17 where I double up  I'll ride it higher but take gains there  Honestly as soon as it stagnates I'm out that's how I dipped out of GME before it dropped  I like the stock but I want my money  I'll buy back when it settles down  And all of this is going to unwind next week I would think  There are a lot of OTM calls that are going to come ITM and they have to settle those buy Wednesday  Mix that with the Russel index listing and we are going to see a lot of buying pressure next week  But my only way of playing at all is to go long and I haven't been doing this very long  But if I could I would be buying up 11 12 13 14 contracts for next week and the week after  Those are very real numbers and the contracts are cheap ,2021-03-18 00:32:57.550335

I wonder if the availability to “cash out” will be capped at $500K thanks to the SIPC?  So say we all cash out at $1 Million/share we end up still only getting a max of $500K each and everything above that becomes basically a “high score”  Will we be seeing “I was supposed to be getting $420 million but I got $500K like the rest of you apes” posts?  Will posts like that simultaneously be loss ***AND*** gain porn?,2021-03-18 00:33:11.382078

Yeah that’s incorrect they don’t have $70trillion to pay anyone    That’s like saying if you accidentally crash your car into a Ferrari dealership Geico will cover the entire bill  NOPE you’re on your own for anything over ~$15k-$100k however much coverage you’ve paid for  DTCC ain’t paying for some hedgies fuck up  It simply will not happen and they were never created to “insure” the markets or hedge funds  They were created to ease trades on the NYSE    DTCC requires brokerages to put up 99% of the cost of their possible securities lost per international protocol for clearing houses  A clearing house is not an insurance company  A clearing house makes sure it has enough of the brokerages money to cover that brokerages trades if they go tits up  Right now the retail market uncovered a pretty massive flaw in the system  Design bug who fucking knows but it certainly is NOT possible to sustain a market that has an unlimited $BRRRR button   DTCC was created to close trades  They are not a regulatory body  These trades aren’t closing bc hedgies are kicking the can down the road  DTCC needs to change its protocols to ensure that the brokerages can cover their increasingly risky trades because THEY CANNOT  DTCC asked RH to put up more collateral to cover their users trades when the price sky rocketed- RH didn’t have the money to put up the 99% collateral so they had to minimize their risk and lower the amount of money they’d have to put up to reach 99%  So RH opted to do that by disabling the purchase of further shares and they secured a loan for the remaining amount  **note:** Gabe fuckin LIED and committed perjury in congress when he said they had enough money- that was FALSE or they wouldn’t have shut down trades and borrowed $2 BILLION    So RH keeps blaming DTCC for asking them to put up additional collateral for the risky trades THEY made on behalf of their users  In theory brokerages are supposed to purchase shares to hedge options their users purchase in order to minimize risk and RH opted to not use their money to do this  That’s why people were saying RH was operating like a Ponzi scheme    Anyway  70 trillion if that is the right amount is not DTCC’s money  They won’t be bailing everyone out  The entire point of DTCC is to ensure that no brokerage gets to the point where they need a bailout since they should be providing DTCC with enough collateral to cover their own risk     They can’t hand out IOUs that’s not a fucking thing   They won’t cover it all because that would be using other brokerages collateral  So DTCC doesn’t own the money  And other brokerages would cut a motherfucker before they’d see their trillions be lost because of Shitadel’s asinine shenanigans    Ya follow?,2021-03-18 00:33:47.463809

> from 2008 we got a poof and short fizzle of protests  well it is very easy when protestors are made out to be degenerate losers and the people they interview and put in the media are mentally ill/homeless people who just show up to the party  That is how they turned occupy wall street in to a joke  There were plenty of people in those crowds who could have told you the main goal was audit the fed and the agenda was loose after that  But they wanted to make it seem like everyone there was just a clueless fool who didn't know what they wanted  Lack of leadership definitely hurt the movement but the biggest issue was not enough people cared    Until people feel the effects of this stuff in real life on a daily basis there will not be any real change  I hate to say that ,2021-03-18 00:37:10.763411

Fidelity has some weird shit going on with options and margin  I think there are minimum cash balances or something for the various levels of options trading as my initial transfer to open my account was small  I have about $3000 worth of holdings with them but my cash balance is nearly $0 right now  I reapplied for options level 3 which requires margin and the response I got was that I was approved for options level 1 again but denied for margin but low and behold I come home and somehow I now have 1:1 margin buying power and still no level 2 options   How you gonna give me margin but not let me trade options  I can naked sort stock but I can't buy calls or puts  How does that make any sense  lol ,2021-03-18 00:38:04.259846

This is all making more and more sense to me  The MOASS has to happen at some point  The only way they could afford to get rid of the synthetic shares was bankruptcy and now the company as we have seen is genuinely a really attractive buy I like the stock the price can’t even get to $40 because everyone will just want more making retail have even more of the total shares  They will just keep endlessly kicking the bucket down like in the housing crisis and making sure they are all individually covered probably destroying evidence and laying the blame on us apes for when this blows up  They knew this was going to happen eventually but I’m guessing the risk is so low and they made so much money before they decided to do it anyway  They will declare bankruptcy my guess next week when the new dtcc law comes in making them covered by the government and suddenly the government has to pay out this short position or risk a recession as everyone invested including other countries see the American stock market as insecure or unable to pay for shares owed  I do agree that the liquidity issue is going to an absolute nightmare and that will slow it down  I also think the squeeze will take time as they navigate paying this  I hope after some new laws are in place as clearly the ones from 2008 have not been enforced properly to stop this behaviour so this can’t happen again  Thanks for the amazing DD and I’m excited for a shake up  Just hope things end up better for the average person and that people actually get held to account  Wishful thinking but still  Also not selling till it happens and if somehow it doesn’t I still like the stock 🤚💎,2021-03-18 00:42:49.060021

There’s a lot to break down with GME and WSB  And it can’t be all done in the one response I’m writing to you now  I was in the original GME gang  I bought my shares at $11 80 each in October last year  Many people who were here before the “age of the apes” were in on it early  Some including myself made big gains on the first squeeze Jan 28th  We sold and moved on/some continued and bought more and There’s nothing inherently wrong with investing in GME or continuing to do so even  The problems are a couple of things  One of which is the animosity between folks most of which were coming from new WSB’ers and newer accounts  Us OG’s got pushed out from our favorite sub  I’m still here clearly now but it’s not the same like OP up here stated  Another problem is among the new GME Gang everyone thinks there is some grand conspiracies and its getting pretty Qanon-ish if you ask me personally  With that said Our ideas and any new DD get downvoted and suppressed daily and are less viewable now in the sub  Since GME its been fairly hard to get traction on a new Yolo or WSB movement as everyone is still obsessed with GME AMC and a couple other memestocks ,2021-03-18 00:43:30.052258

You're right but I think a couple things you said are misleading  Firstly having a short position does not always mean you have infinite risk  Short selling specifically though does introduce infinite risk  A market maker can create shares but only intra-day  They create shares intra-day by naked short selling but are required I believe by the SEC to have a neutral position by the end of the trading day  The synthetic shares don't really come from the MMs  There are parties though that own shares that are willing to lend them out  to be sold short  They are willing to do this because they collect a fee as long as those shares are being borrowed  Those borrowed shares can even be sold back to the same party that lent them out to be sold short lent out again and sold short again a theoretical unlimited amount of times  That's how the short interest can be so insanely high even without anyone breaking any laws ,2021-03-18 00:43:42.447434

got u friend       And ah that makes sense  Well as long as you know where to look now for when those purchases go through my job is complete  Do keep in mind that when you initiate your transfer any partial shares will be sold on your behalf  I had a few in my account and decided I would sell them myself  Cash in your account will ALSO be transferred over but it might take a bit longer than everything else  Bank transfers will not be possible throughout most of the process so either sell your partials and bank transfer at the beginning or be patient and let everything sit during the transfer       There is also a $75 transfer fee that Robinhood charges  This charge the first time hit my Fidelity account as a debit  I cannot confirm if this would hit your Robinhood account if there was cash in it but I imagine that is a possibility  To have this fee waived I'd recommend trying your luck with Fidelity's customer service it's not guaranteed but it's worth a request- they were kind enough to cover mine ,2021-03-18 00:43:51.029377

You’re not insider trading rules for employees at all FAANG prevent you buying/selling any point outside approved trading windows   and prevents any options playing at all   You also can’t hold any ETF that holds 10% of your company 24/7/365   not that even QQQ has 10% diversity for any FAANG company   Still it sucks ,2021-03-18 00:43:55.654365

You are assuming that caps will be placed if the price surges to 100k or more  However that assumption relies on every single holder actually hold till 100k  Most people quite frankly will sell a lot earlier than that  The incredible dips that stock will face will only leave very few holding at the very top  In that case there is sufficient capital to settle  Additionally there will be some absolute apes who don’t sell at all and will be called into legal arbitration with the govt acting as the intermediary ,2021-03-18 00:44:52.324628
I have noticed a trend of broader market rising as gme falls and vice versa  However the broader market is more sensitive to bond yield news as of late  Gme has already hit its cap twice though going to the moon is just part of the memeness here  If you dont believe people are getting out at 300+ when they got in under say 70 dollars a share in the last few months you will be saying hold the line when everyone has moved on  It's a casino stock and easy to make money on but not by buying shares at 200+,2021-03-18 00:44:52.324785

I genuinely appreciate your reply  Part of the reason I made this thread was to hear counter points  So just understand that my coming reply is not sarcastic    Do you really believe they reached 140% without naked shorts? Because I find that very hard to believe that would have required them borrowing massive quantities in GME a stock where a very large quantity of its volume involves long term retail investors  When they could have just naked shorted it like many financial institutions typically do because there is very little they have to disclose anyways and they’ve done it that way for a long time without problems ,2021-03-18 00:45:28.521178

"Copy and pasting my comment on another $GME thread - hope you at least find it interesting:  Some of my thoughts  In regard to 2/24/2021 - I think this is about $SLGG as:  1  $GME is trying to get into the world of Esports and it's clear to see that based on their test stores    2  During the last earnings call for $SLGG Ann Hand said the following:  ""So if that retail partner is interested in pop-up Esports experiences or other types of entertainment I think that's another retail licensing subscription type model where we can offer them to pay some kind of toll gate or monthly fee to use our technology to drive more people into their venues  I like that  **That was always the original vision of the retail model was at some point we just really let the brick and mortar owner do the heavy lifting as far as marketing the event  They know their customer better than anyone ** Getting people there making sure it's a great experience not Super League doing it from afar and so I think with the vaccinations getting underway when we come back to retail we'll have a much cleaner model with a stronger margin profile""  You tell me what brick-and-mortar gaming retail store ""knows their customer better than anyone"" other than Gamestop    3  Ryan's previous tweet is a reference to the ""So you're telling me there's a chance"" scene from Dumb and Dumber  See [here]https://youtu be/nFTRwD85AQ4  Lloyd: ""What do you think the chances are of uh a guy like you and a girl like me    ending up together?""  Relationships = partnerships partnership with $SLGG?  On a side note I thought it was weird that he tweeted so much about Dumb and Dumber - I mean why that movie? If you google ""Dumb and Dumber March"" you come across this:  ""Just before Harry and Lloyd reach Colorado they stop a service station for fuel  While Harry flirts with an African American woman named Beth Lloyd uses the men's restroom  **In a stall he finds a message saying to be in the stall on March 25th at 2:15 A M  for manly love **""  Pretty weird huh? Very close to earnings too   P S  here's a fun fact - Penny in ""Dumb and Dumber To"" is played by Rachel **Melvin**",2021-03-18 00:48:24.817774

The club is doing better today than it was pre pandemic   Definitely not losing money   And as the restrictions get lifted and people feel more comfortable business will boom   Also social experiences don't require social interaction   Some people just like the shared experiences and the energy of being around others   Like I'm not trying to talk to people during a concert or comedy show   Think of how many people go to a coffee shop just to be around people while they keep to themselves   This behavior will come back with a vengeance as we enter a post pandemic world ,2021-03-18 00:48:27.454685

I really wish the US would enforce the 30 Ct threshold for positive cases and reporting and stop using anything over 30 because those numbers are not useful metrics per CDC themselves for reporting nor public policy  We'd have a LOT less cases by a factor of 10x less because those people who tested positive over 30 do not have a live virus and the remnants of any leftover virus are not transmittable    Yet last I read we are still testing over the max threshold and 30 cycles are enough to get useful data ,2021-03-18 00:48:36.612929

So much of this is wrong in my opinion  Yes the government can step in but this a worldwide investment now do you realise how bad that looks on the USA stock market  If the Hedge funds are to big to fail then why were they talking about bankruptcy at the hearing? And who do you think the long whales are? Not retail others will ensure payment and the government will pay  Even more dangerous not to maybe it won’t be like expected but it will happen  Also intrinsic value maybe before this happened they had less  Now Ryan Cohen massive upgrades to e commerce many films and documentaries about GameStop and the general whole squeeze has made them popular then ever with a loyal fan base  And if you think people are going to sell at 40 you are wrong  People will buy more and change to the long game all pointing towards a bullish long term investment   You clearly don’t have a position with GameStop and for some reason are on here spreading doubt instead  Sell your shares if you do and get out  Follow your own advice,2021-03-18 00:49:45.191097

Suuure you are  I'll get started on those anger management classes as soon as you learn to read  They can pay off most of a bailout with capital gains taxes from this very fuckery alone  That's money they'd never see if it stayed on hedgie books that will go to any lengths to offshore it and avoid paying their fair share  And they'll collect those every damn year in perpetuity as these newly minted retail investors dive back into the market  This is the great reset everyone's been jabbering about for years ,2021-03-18 00:50:04.406209

I’ll explain in another comment    The DTCC just passed a new rule into effect by filing it  This out it into effect as written clearly in the document    On page ten of the document the DTCC clears **itself of any liability on THEIR PART**  What this means to my smooth-brain and what smarter apes go in to comment in the thread below is that the DTCC is clearing itself of criminal wrongdoing but still they are responsible for the bill ,2021-03-18 00:50:06.139665

No   It was revealed in January that they never purchased any shares of GME that their customers ordered and instead issued CFDs   So when the price spiked they didn't have the capital to cover the purchase and in effect WERE margin called   But they turned off the buy and worked a deal so they didn't get liquidated   If they had to buy at market value that day it would have been about 2 5 billion    Hence why they raised 3 billion real fast ,2021-03-18 00:50:12.054399

I like this Your logic is sound I feel you are completely right  But    There is a certain assumption that these people are going to be rational about this   DTCC as a company probably shouldn't care about Citadel but the actual people running the show? They all see each other at parties and at the links; their wives probably talk  If there is one other thing we also know about these dudes it's that there is a Club  Club members help other Club members stay in and keep the little guys out  And the added problem is that it has almost always worked in the past  I could see a scenario where the people at DTCC somehow leave retail holding the bag AGAIN and just assume they will suffer no consequences for that  I just don't know if we can rule out hubris ,2021-03-18 00:50:24.497221

No fuckin way bud  No fuckin way    This sub is right about a lot wrong about way more and completely delusional when it comes to where the money comes and goes from    I won’t give financial advice but let’s just say I sold only enough to cover my buy in and the rest is being held in my diamond hands  I won’t be a bag holder but I’m content to just be along for the ride ,2021-03-18 00:50:27.633285

See I completely disagree with this  The average person has been screwed over so many times by the government and the super rich elites  It’s practically ingrained within us and we often justify it as the way of life no matter how pissed we get  We all know that the rich live by a different set of rules  Bribe and cheat out of every situation  What’s even more perplexing is how quick people forget  The government has done so many shady shit in the past that we just sweep under the rug  We’re just little peons  Sure it sucks but we have very little power  The only power we have is too sit out and say “Fuck this game!” But 2 years later were right back in  The game is rigged against us and has always been  To think they’d play by the rules just because of potential repercussions is just not how it works  Moreover it’ll be retails fault if market crashes  And who’s gonna listen to us the press? They’ve been bought off since day 1,2021-03-18 00:51:07.529090

I never said the cinema is dead  I said I dont see it expanding unless something revolutionionary will come  Home cinemas become cheaper and cheaper  It might be just me but I certainly prefer to watch movies at my own TV because the quality is just so much better  I only go to see some new IMAX experiences  Cinema will stay it just won't take your investment to the moon  That's just my opinion    As for PlayStation's store MS Store or steam  Maybe GameStop won't even directly compete with this  They'll find new ways to attract customers with exclusive deals and communities  Also GameStop doesn't just sell games but also hardware gaming related merchandise and more  When Chewy launched there were shit load of pet food onlinres and yet it became a giant with almost 34 billion market cap  Also they just got loads of free advertisement  The whole world is talking about GameStop ,2021-03-18 00:52:12.577826

Any good subreddit to discuss on this topic?

Assuming GME hits $1000 mcap will be $60billion  $60 billion theoretically can’t crash a $100 trillion marketplace  Not to mention this is all based on the assumption that everybody bag holds forever  Not gonna happen  It’s a great story and maybe some folks go bankrupt but once the bag holders start selling and they will it doesn’t matter if the price is $100 or $100000    it’ll drop so fast the market orders will get crushed so fast the remaining short sellers can just sit back and wait for the price to crash  Which it will  Very few GME holders will be able to get out with a profit it’ll happen too fast   with or without intervention ,2021-03-18 00:54:40.950707
Right well thank you I/Bows_N_Hoes  I can see your points loud and clearly  Fellow GME and AMC gorilla here    DISCLAIMER - this is not financial advice this is merely a conversation to better share knowledge   First I’d like to say that indeed the closer we get to the squeeze and definitely during the squeeze the relation between GME and the market will be inverse  But at the moment it’s not too strong  I’ve been observing the market and GME  I’ve seen that there are times where when the whole market is positive so is GME  And I’ve also seen multiple times where GME was green in a sea of red  Therefore I’d say that right now GME and the market are somewhat unrelated   I believe this would be due to GME being in the transitioning phase into becoming inversely related  Furthermore the current GME BETA is reported to be -1 92 to reports that the BETA is -8  Which is ridiculous and has never been seen before in the market and should not theoretically exist   Secondly you say that this will drive blue chip stocks like Amazon into bankruptcy  IMO I’m quite sure this won’t happen  I do agree that Shitadel and many other MMs will have to close basically all of their positions in the market in their other stocks in order to pay us back and that will make the whole market sell off crazy  But it’ll only be temporary and everything will return to normal after this because if it doesn’t the wealth system in America will be broken  This in the worst case scenario the government will step in as well as any other bodies with responsibility and step in to pay us    Thirdly from what I’ve read you seem like a RH advocate  You’re allowed to have your opinion but personally I highly disagree  Indeed a lot of brokers in first squeeze did have to temporarily stop GME orders  But the difference is that RH had their sell button still active  I was in there I have my holdings in EToro and although they stopped buy orders  They also deactivated sell orders like the rest of them EXCEPT RH  And that’s why RH are b@st@rds  Indeed I believe that this squeeze will be so great that no broker will have the liquid on deck to handle them all  AND THATS TOTALLY FINE  I’m going to hold until we are at the moon at $100000+ I don’t mind AS LONG AS THEY deactivate both the buy and sell button  I will gladly hold on to my stock until these mother f*clefs got all of our money right and then let the squeeze continue 🚀🚀🚀  HODL THE LINE  THIS WILL BE ONE OF OUR GREATEST STOCK VICTORY AND EVENT IN OUR LIFETIME 💎🦍🚀🚀🚀,2021-03-18 00:54:41.054061

FUD to tie up shares in limbo as accounts transfer perhaps? Less buying and even less selling if the MOASS happens while shares are transferring ,2021-03-18 00:55:13.620108

I did a full account transfer  I was able to transfer cash to my bank either 1 before I initiated the transfer or 2 shortly after I initiated the transfer  I can't remember definitively but I see the record for that withdrawal       I would just attempt to withdraw any cash to your bank right now then do a full account transfer if there is only GME in your account       And I initiated this transfer through Fidelity  I do believe there is an option to only do specific shares but I didn't go that route  The little cash I had left in my RH account made it to Fidelity just fine eventually ,2021-03-18 00:55:25.730622

"It is insured by all the major banks and the entire financial system  So a ""claim"" on that $70t would just result in collapse of the entire financial sector of the US and likely the world    Not gonna happen  If it came to that they would just take our shares and say ""fuck you"" courtesy of Uncle Sam  Pretty sure the world economy doesn't give a shit about us so we will definitely get screwed if it really came down to it  That said it would literally have to go to $1mil per share which is laughable ",2021-03-18 00:55:59.182566

I truly believe that there will be a plateau of sorts where not many retail investor will be able to buy a stock price and it’ll just be the hedgies/market makers clamoring to cover  The volume will be less volatile and it’ll be a slow peel of a banana as the price shoots up because apes are 💎🙌  Retail will then drop off as they reach a price point they are comfortable exiting with a profit  I don’t see everyone holding until 1 million a share    it’s simply unrealistic  People are gonna take profits so some may stick around until 1 million is realized but not the majority ,2021-03-18 00:56:30.274304

Well yes   But the casino doesn’t have anywhere near that much cash to pay out their obligation  At best they have to file bankruptcy and you get a fraction of that initial winnings    Same thing with GME  If it went up to some crazy number its market capitalization would theoretically be worth like a trillion  The shorts don’t have that money  Ape losses either way ,2021-03-18 00:57:50.120919

Sure it's true a gamma squeeze can happen any trading day  If there is enough buying volume to warrant it  But its less likely than it is on a Friday due to the pending expirations   Similarly MM's are much more likely to hedge immediately on a Friday for the same reason  In the alternative if there is a massive influx of calls purchased on a Monday MM's may choose to leave these calls unhedged depending on a number of factors relating to the underlying stock  For example if the stock has low volatility such as a BB or NOK the MM's will be less inclined to hedge 100 shares on a call option purchased on a Monday when in all likelihood the price may recede back down below the strike thus making the hedge unnecessary    Regardless you are right  Doesn't have to be a Friday but it is more likely  And it is also more likely MM's hedge immediately on a Friday due to expiry ,2021-03-18 00:58:31.478886

Excluding synthetic and ETF shares lower float leads to more volatility  I don't know what the trade algos use to set prices but I see low volume as attack points because of the above explanation  This places the options market in a precarious position because of how sensitive the price is  Now enter synthetic shares/ETFs/shorters/etc who are actively trading this and I think this explains the price movements lately  I personally believe the 50 million share float is 30-45 million held long and not trading  We've probably been in an out of this a few times 3/10 and 3/16  I am not seeing an increase in traded volume since 3/8  it's decreasing  Most action is prior to lunch followed buy afternoon selling  I'm not sure what's really going on but someone is making big moves  look at bloody Monday 3/10 on 1 min tick at 12:18  It looks like someone put doubling selling pressure each tick and let off at 12:22 saw no resistance and pushed HARD to propel selloffs/stoplosses  What gets me is that the volume goes 100k->184k->340k->459k->0->900k so about 2mil shares,2021-03-18 00:58:56.499002

None of this is deterring me from liking RH so far  The UI is easy which is very helpful  Bigger issue yes they got margin called for $3B but it’s because we swarmed them unexpectedly  Y’all called for aid and we myself included showed up to help  More of us showed up than anyone anticipated in fact  Remember how the mods here struggled under the weight of our response AND had to fight off a bunch of other crap at the same time? DO YOU REMEMBER THAT MONKEYS??   So our little boy from Bulgaria got woken up at stupid o goddamn clock to be told he needed to come up with 3 effing billion dollars and promptly shit his pants right? So he changes his pants and has to pick the least shitty option for everyone to come up with the green  So he’s forced to make a deal with a devil to make sure we can stay in the game and it doesn’t crash down around us  It’s not a good deal but it probably was the best he could do  But did he sell us out forever?   Orrrr did he use the opportunity to pivot so he can support us when we inevitably DO IT AGAIN? Vladdy boy is flashing signs he’s DTF when we get his head off of the hedgies chopping block  I happen to think he’s trying to be on our side and so I’m keeping my account    I’m not a dummy though so I have a backup account on etrade in case shit goes down again    TLDR: RH and Vlad are the most likely of the big players to support us if any  We should make that possible for them instead of hating them forever ,2021-03-18 00:59:27.747653

So a TON of the “GME is going to $1000 $10000 $10000000” is based on comments from Thomas Peterffy  Yet apparently not one person here besides me looked at the evidence and did the math to show he was full of shit    I believe he said there were call options with 150M shares underlying that were open that dealers wouldn’t have been able to deliver the shares for hence they needed to stop buying or the “system would collapse” and stock price would have gone above $1000   **Except** I checked  Wednesday 1/27 the OI in GME calls was 110000  Which equals 11M shares not 150M  Thursday 1/28 after they limited buying it went to 150000  Which equals 15M shares    And guess what? The stock closed Wednesday 1/27 at $347  Thursday morning they limited buying  Friday it closed at     $325   Lo and behold we’re all still here  The system didn’t collapse    Amazing this sub is so distrustful of anything but not when it confirms their biases  Old rich white dude who spews some bullsht on CNBC to excuse why his brokerage had to stop people from buying because it couldn’t meet collateral calls from NSCC or it’s clearinghouse and people eat it up because it’s what they want to hear ,2021-03-18 01:00:16.993167

I'll say the same thing I said over at the other subreddit   1  I'm under the impression that new documents became available revealing more details about RH's underhanded dealings  2  If the accepted DD is correct then it won't matter if you are in the middle of a transfer when the MOASS hits  They need your shares to cover and you will have plenty of time to sell  3  The MOASS has been expected any day for literally months now  Every week there is a new DD out about why it's going to be this week  It hasn't happened yet  This is probably why people are still in RH in the first place - they've been perpetually scared into believing transferring today will cause them to miss the MOASS tomorrow   I can't guarantee that they won't miss the MOASS anymore than you can guarantee that they will  What's important to understand is that regardless of if the new information about RH is correct or not RH is not any investor's friend and they are in cahoots with Citadel and others  Do you really want to keep trusting them with your money?,2021-03-18 01:00:21.047796

Of course but it's like people keep forgetting a couple things  One the it goes our cap gains taxes are in lockstep with it  A huge amount of whatever is paid out assuming they are angling for a bailout they get right back from us  Also don't tell anyone I said this but the people eyeing 500k-1m+ per share should be more realistic  At that point yes I agree with you it becomes untenable and poses a systemic threat but the DTCC could employ any number of strategies that ensure the majority of retail can achieve a satisfactory exit leaving the short hedges as the only real loser ,2021-03-18 01:00:45.958828

"No problem sorry if i came off a bit cross at first   Your question is a really hard one to answer  I believe but have no data to support the large majority of these shorts are ""natural"" simply because i see no reason they wouldnt be  Retail holders dont always get a direct say in whether or not their shares are available for borrowing usually the brokerage takes that decision for them  Add in the fact that a relatively ""small"" pool of shares such as those held by retail brokers or funds like vanguard blackrock or even XRT can be shorted bought up and reshorted I see no reason to believe why this wouldn't be the case    Don't get me wrong naked shorting does happen i just dont think the scale of it is as enormous as people here seem to believe",2021-03-18 01:02:06.999406

I am so happy for people who made money on this short squeeze but I’d sell it immediately  I just don’t understand the long term play here  Enlighten me please ,2021-03-18 01:02:51.096797

I think what you're missing is how much of an influx of buying was happening over a period of time  IB is clearly going to have algo's running to alert them of any pending doom  They're not going to wait until it's too late to do something      Your logic is flawed  Also 110000 open interest at what strike? There was Likely over 100000 OI on a specific strike in total that would be an underwhelming day of volume    Look at this week there is something like 44000 OI on an $800 strike ,2021-03-18 01:03:06.628980

I’m on the GME gravy train too but I’m not liking the echo chamber vibe either  I like reading dissenting opinions it makes my brain do this funny thing called thinking  So when I see people *commanding* me to hold my investment I just have to laugh  Future bag-holder for sure,2021-03-18 01:03:58.393911

The US market is not stagnant it’s people’s money being given to companies that people believe in to grow and return value  In your theory the entire market would become worthless and the select few million people who hold GME would own everything   Your parents/family/neighbours/your 401K? Worthless gone totally evaporated  Every public company in the US? Worthless no capital to continue   If all of the wealth was redistributed to a select few million people holding GME shares how do you think that would affect the system?  Anyone not in GME would have absolutely nothing? People who didn’t buy GME would have their assets valued at 0 even if they didn’t sell?   Trust me the SEC would give you $1000 a share and a big old fuck you before they risked funnelling every Americans investments to a few million people ,2021-03-18 01:03:58.394162

Thanks for the reply   1 I’m not predicting nor expecting blue chip stocks like TSLA AAPL etc  to bankrupt from this I’m saying they will suffer serious corrections purely from the short holders liquidating their massive long term positions  I’m not expecting a total economic crash just a very very red day/week on the market  2 I’m not a RH supporter at all in fact I’ve never even used their app  I just believe they are pawn in all this  Also many brokers besides RH halted the buys not as much as RH but many of the brokers did  So I do believe their is some merit to RH’s argument that they did not have enough liquidity    I actually believe what scares brokers the most with this squeeze is not just the final payout when people finally click sell but all the FOMO buys that hop on when it’s rocketing off which i find understandable because that is a very scary right rope to walk as a brokerage ,2021-03-18 01:04:07.134465

*In a world where memestonks never happened*   This is not a valuation of real value of the company it is the money injected from the biggest squeeze of our times  It would not crash anything maybe only for a short while  The money will transfer from hedge funds to GameStop and retail and then normalize back around where it will  In a world where memestonks did happen this is posing a changing concept of money and wealth  as well as memes as assets  There is enough money in offshores the hedgefucks have to cover all these issues  This is maybe not FUD but try to make a more objective claim wherein what would need to happen for it to occur and then it’s a better post ,2021-03-18 01:04:44.349842

I've been a GME bull and diamondhander since January but I have some concerns about GME and I want someone to refute them if they can  This is not FUD I want GME to soar I really actually just want someone to convince me my concerns are unfounded   I've read all the DD out there and have taken it into consideration  I think some DD have inaccurate or misleading info and overall having read all the DD I'm still not currently convinced on the bull case   My concern is we don't know whats going on at all the most we have is guess work  Our theory is a long whale triggered the price increase on Feb 24th and has been on our side since but they could take profits and dip any time and we won't know  Volume is an indicator long whales are involved Last Wednesday was the most bullish day for price action before the major short attack  Since then we haven't seen volume to indicate long whales are involved   Last Friday a ton of options were set to go ITM if price closed above 300  We were so close probably would've made it with volume and GME was on SSR list  Yet somehow that volume never came whales let it close below 300   This week we saw a pretty significant price drop from 280 to 200  Still no volume  I bought more in anticipation of stimmy boost but that seemed to barely make a dent   Tomorrow GME is off SSR and will probably be shorted more    My fear is that long whales have dipped and/or funds are playing retail for a pump and dump  and squeeze case is no longer present which could be the case if they did already cover or are covering with synthetic shares -- note that interest borrow rate is super low why? does anyone have the answer? with the premise that while retail things there is still a squeeze cash funds are pumping then dumping on us taking profits each time   I thought about exiting 1/5 of my shares today just to take some profit recover a minimum amount of my cost and maybe buy back in lower tomorrow when and if it dips which many knowledgeable people think it will  I didn't end up doing it  I hope I don't regret it but overall I'm nervous   On the one hand catalysts do exist like earnings call and potential catalysts like Ryan Cohen CEO announcement or board vote to recall shares but none of those things are certain and on some level its surprising to me they didn't already recall shares  We're kinda coasting on blind faith at this point   What would make the most sense for me to mitigate risk would be to sell enough to recover my cost basis and play with casino money which many have done  But on a deeper level I do still really want this to moon and moon with maximum amount of shares I can have on hand   If someone is able to refute my concerns please do ,2021-03-18 01:08:24.267682

I will do my best just commented on another with similar theory  Think about it why are we still seeing shares borrowed and dumped on us like recently why all the negative shills and bots why the shorting of etfs that we can see  Does any of that make you think this is the action of a hedge fund that has covered their short position  If you have covered it then why keep spending millions and millions on these tactics to keep the price down  To me that screams they are still in and I think they are more in then ever before  Be interesting to see just how much when this is over  I would worry they had covered if we had none of these actions going on but I do believe they have only prolonged it  Hope that helps and gives you some encouragement 🤚💎,2021-03-18 01:08:38.954873

HOLY MOLY!!! Alright listen up retards! I just got off the phone with fidelity customer service after being put on hold for nearly a fucking hour and I received so really fucking good information  yea who know having a broker that actually has a customer service hotline as opposed to having to send in an email and wait 3 days for a response would be nice 😂🤷  Okey so i called with the intention of canceling my transfer from Robinhood to Fidelity because I thought that this entire transfer narrative felt like total FUD and it somewhat is because it definitely manipulated me into acting emotionally  I talked with the representative and got to ask him some questions and here are some parts of the conversation:  Q: is it too late to cancel my transfer right now?  A: it is too late to cancel your transfer right now from fidelity's side i would have to contact robinhood and have them cancel it boo email customer service fucking sucks  HOWEVER it is possible to cancel it myself if i just either buy or sell something on my robinhood account as it would make my account not match up and the transfer would not go through! This is for full transfers i did not ask about partial transfers   Q: does initiating the transfer completely freeze my account?  A: no my account on robinhood does not get frozen up until one or two days before the actual transfer goes through i would see my shares go into my fidely account 1 or 2 days after my account on robinhood gets locked right in the morning so if your account gets frozen Monday your shares would end up in fidelity on Tuesday or at the latest Wednesday  He said this was specific for Robinhood and that other brokers might not work the same he specifically said that with schwab the moment you initiate the transfer your account will get locked  Q: so does that mean i have some leeway in when I can still cancel my transfer?  A: yes since my transfer is scheduled to go through for the 24th of March Wednesday next week i more or less have until the end of this week to decide if I want to either buy or sell literally any stock which would cancel my transfer depending on how fast robinhood goes through with processing the transfer at this point but he seemed pretty confident it wouldn't happen at least until Monday or Tuesday but wasn't 100% sure  TLDR: if you feel like you were manipulated and initiated your transfer due to that post regarding Robinhood not actually owning your shares back in January it is still possible to cancel your transfer yourself works for full transfers not 100% sure on partial transfers by either buying or selling literally any stock as it would make the accounts not match up and this the transfer would be declined  And apparently you have some leeway for sure tomorrow possibly Friday as well ,2021-03-18 01:09:23.756121

I'll say the same thing I said over at the other subreddit   1 	⁠I'm under the impression that new documents became available revealing more details about RH's underhanded dealings  2 	⁠If the accepted DD is correct then it won't matter if you are in the middle of a transfer when the MOASS hits  They need your shares to cover and you will have plenty of time to sell  3 	⁠The MOASS has been expected any day for literally months now  Every week there is a new DD out about why it's going to be this week  It hasn't happened yet  This is probably why people are still in RH in the first place - they've been perpetually scared into believing transferring today will cause them to miss the MOASS tomorrow   I can't guarantee that they won't miss the MOASS anymore than you can guarantee that they will  What's important to understand is that regardless of if the new information about RH is correct or not RH is not any investor's friend and they are in cahoots with Citadel and others  Do you really want to keep trusting them with your money?,2021-03-18 01:09:24.846327

Assuming for a moment that they are in fact so dumb as to turn their backs on retail and Blackrock Vanguard Fidelity Morgan etc just for the sake of a few short hedge funds which they won't they also have government to contend with  Assuming anyone in public office is capable of grasping the implications of this situation to not act or to act on the side of the shorts is a death sentence for the administration and likely the career of everyone that is part of it  Retail investors that don't even know about GME will come looking for answers when their 401k takes a 40% hit which it will whether this squeeze happens or not  And a vote costs nothing ,2021-03-18 01:09:33.845178

You're missing the point  No one told Melvin Capital to short synthetic shares which is illegal  No one told the SEC not to step in  The HFs are going unchecked and steam rolling not only retail investors but companies as well they could have literally shorted GME and AMC out of existence in this pandemic economy   The short attacks and short interests throughout the market exceed the regulated allowance yet no one steps in    I'm not breaking any laws by holding a stock that I like  We could have gone to $1000 everyone knows it and we can get there again  Melvin Capital has over $8 billion under management they better start liquidating positions and cover  And stop trying to blame GME retail investors that are holding the stock for market crashes and grandma's pension/401k we didn't cause the situation  We didn't violate any regulations  We didn't sell naked shorts  The HFs did this ,2021-03-18 01:09:34.950698

This is a copy pasted of what I posted on the daily discussion but essentially it is still possible to cancel your transfer if you want to assuming you did a full transfer like i did  HOLY MOLY!!! Alright listen up retards! I just got off the phone with fidelity customer service after being put on hold for nearly a fucking hour and I received so really fucking good information  yea who know having a broker that actually has a customer service hotline as opposed to having to send in an email and wait 3 days for a response would be nice 😂🤷  Okey so i called with the intention of canceling my transfer from Robinhood to Fidelity because I thought that this entire transfer narrative felt like total FUD and it somewhat is because it definitely manipulated me into acting emotionally  I talked with the representative and got to ask him some questions and here are some parts of the conversation:  Q: is it too late to cancel my transfer right now?  A: it is too late to cancel your transfer right now from fidelity's side i would have to contact robinhood and have them cancel it boo email customer service fucking sucks  HOWEVER it is possible to cancel it myself if i just either buy or sell something on my robinhood account as it would make my account not match up and the transfer would not go through! This is for full transfers i did not ask about partial transfers   Q: does initiating the transfer completely freeze my account?  A: no my account on robinhood does not get frozen up until one or two days before the actual transfer goes through i would see my shares go into my fidely account 1 or 2 days after my account on robinhood gets locked right in the morning so if your account gets frozen Monday your shares would end up in fidelity on Tuesday or at the latest Wednesday  He said this was specific for Robinhood and that other brokers might not work the same he specifically said that with schwab the moment you initiate the transfer your account will get locked  Q: so does that mean i have some leeway in when I can still cancel my transfer?  A: yes since my transfer is scheduled to go through for the 24th of March Wednesday next week i more or less have until the end of this week to decide if I want to either buy or sell literally any stock which would cancel my transfer depending on how fast robinhood goes through with processing the transfer at this point but he seemed pretty confident it wouldn't happen at least until Monday or Tuesday but wasn't 100% sure  TLDR: if you feel like you were manipulated and initiated your transfer due to that post regarding Robinhood not actually owning your shares back in January it is still possible to cancel your transfer yourself works for full transfers not 100% sure on partial transfers by either buying or selling literally any stock as it would make the accounts not match up and this the transfer would be declined  And apparently you have some leeway for sure tomorrow possibly Friday as well ,2021-03-18 01:12:08.022933

Thanks for the clarification  I agree with all of what you’ve said and yeah that’s gonna be the crazy part  The fact that they’ve caused the inverse relationship between the stock and the market  Making GME the best hedge against the market drop  Meaning a lot of blue chip holders may find a lot of value in buying this stock  And there will be extreme FOMO  There will be a lot of buying pressure  The time lag between MMs trying to get cash will be so significant that by the time they have the cash on deck the price will have already risen higher so they’d potentially never have enough in time  Furthermore It truly is possible for gamma squeezes and short squeezes to infinitely knock on top of each other keeping the squeeze going and going  There will be a lot of new idiots and hedgefunds that will try to ride down the squeeze only to keep getting squoze dry  This is all just my own opinion but oh man  This is all getting me PUMPED UP,2021-03-18 01:12:37.517006

Basically if the allegations are true which i think they are buying GME shares in RH doesn't actually assign you shares  They may say you've been assigned shares and if you sell they may pull some shit in the background to make it look like you sold and deposit the right amount of money in your account but you actually never physically owned the shares  This is a real problem for everyone not just RH users because when RH users go to buy shares RH is not going out into the market and actually acquiring them so no buy pressure is being applied which is what we need to get the price to go up   Its one of the reasons this gme stuff is such a mess  Shares are being traded that don't actually exist,2021-03-18 01:12:54.140220

1  Solid earnings 1 2B in net income last quarter 700% YOY growth 2  Nice clean balance sheet with little  debt 3  Fat dividend yield was almost 5% at yesterdays prices   i wouldnt be surprised if they increased it if new share prices hold paid quarterly 4  No rate increase until 2023 per FED happened today this means strong home buying and refinancing activity likely to continue 5  Inclusion into the Russell Index on 3/22 as a short term catalyst 6  Undervalued relative to its competitors that earn a similar amount   I personally don't believe there's going to be a squeeze but its very undervalued when taking all that into consideration    especially the market cap relative to its peers  I can see this sitting comfortably in the 14-16 range in the next 3 months ,2021-03-18 01:12:58.562665
This is copy pasted that i posted on the daily discussion!!  HOLY MOLY!!! Alright listen up retards! I just got off the phone with fidelity customer service after being put on hold for nearly a fucking hour and I received so really fucking good information  yea who know having a broker that actually has a customer service hotline as opposed to having to send in an email and wait 3 days for a response would be nice 😂🤷  Okey so i called with the intention of canceling my transfer from Robinhood to Fidelity because I thought that this entire transfer narrative felt like total FUD and it somewhat is because it definitely manipulated me into acting emotionally  I talked with the representative and got to ask him some questions and here are some parts of the conversation:  Q: is it too late to cancel my transfer right now?  A: it is too late to cancel your transfer right now from fidelity's side i would have to contact robinhood and have them cancel it boo email customer service fucking sucks  HOWEVER it is possible to cancel it myself if i just either buy or sell something on my robinhood account as it would make my account not match up and the transfer would not go through! This is for full transfers i did not ask about partial transfers   Q: does initiating the transfer completely freeze my account?  A: no my account on robinhood does not get frozen up until one or two days before the actual transfer goes through i would see my shares go into my fidely account 1 or 2 days after my account on robinhood gets locked right in the morning so if your account gets frozen Monday your shares would end up in fidelity on Tuesday or at the latest Wednesday  He said this was specific for Robinhood and that other brokers might not work the same he specifically said that with schwab the moment you initiate the transfer your account will get locked  Q: so does that mean i have some leeway in when I can still cancel my transfer?  A: yes since my transfer is scheduled to go through for the 24th of March Wednesday next week i more or less have until the end of this week to decide if I want to either buy or sell literally any stock which would cancel my transfer depending on how fast robinhood goes through with processing the transfer at this point but he seemed pretty confident it wouldn't happen at least until Monday or Tuesday but wasn't 100% sure  TLDR: if you feel like you were manipulated and initiated your transfer due to that post regarding Robinhood not actually owning your shares back in January it is still possible to cancel your transfer yourself works for full transfers not 100% sure on partial transfers by either buying or selling literally any stock as it would make the accounts not match up and this the transfer would be declined  And apparently you have some leeway for sure tomorrow possibly Friday as well ,2021-03-18 01:12:58.563162

"Sometimes religion reminds me of a comedian I saw years ago   He asked the audience to stand up and put their hands on their heads  They did   He lit a ciggy and took a couple of long slow pulls on it   Next he asked them to turn to their neighbour and tell them ""you look great today""  And they did  He took another leisurely draw on his cigarette   Next he told them to spin in a circle before sitting down  They did   After another slow and deliberate tug on his cig he paused and then simply announced   ""the fucking things you can get people to do just by being on stage and asking them to ""  And that for me is good comedy because it makes us reflect on daily life and things that we take as 'normal'   Religion is like that  Does 'God' require is to dance in a circle and do whatever else these lads are up to incantations or whatever? Like fuck 'He' does  We are God  We are a sliver of The Creator and 'he' doesn't require us to kiss 'his' ass or worship 'him' or whatever  We are sailing in a sea of infinity have agreed to be here in this time and space and figure out that we create our own reality and hey if this floats your boat go for it but none of these rituals is a golden ticket to the great Willy Wonka factory in the sky   God Bless them though they're cute and they're having fun so fair play to them ",2021-03-18 01:14:48.527120

It would be interesting to go down the list researching each company trying to identify whether the thesis has changed  Shorting is not always a bad thing   If you can find one that is heavily shorted and you believe the reasons it was shorted are no longer valid and there are foreseeable catalysts for a turnaround then buy and wait  You could become DFV  But make sure you read both sides of the argument for/against the stock  Contrarian plays don't usually play out as well as GME has ,2021-03-18 01:16:37.460842

Well let's see here     margin calls short positions oh yeah and were talking about options so there's put contracts where if you happen to sell a contract for let's say 5 contracts at 500 and the stock goes down any amount below the premium let's say 10 then it gets executed you have to buy 500 stocks at a total of 250k leaving you 245k in debt that you have to pay out of pocket    uh oh lil Timmy lied and he works a job that pays him 40k a year and has 30k in total savings meaning realistically if he has any debt it could take him 10+ years to pay back that 215k  So who has to pay off that 215k difference? Well fidelity since their the brokerage tied up in it since you just CANT not fulfill the contract but they allowed him to make that contract under the knowledge given to them that this person should EASILY be able to cover that debt  Their being defrauded of safety and non-liability knowledge that allows them to conduct good faith business and securities in the trade,2021-03-18 01:17:05.884340

Guaranteed   Literally were either looking at a government bailout or the greatest shit show in history being proved that the stock market is NOT for retail traders but just for the major funds and firms to make money off of us   That will    be depressing    Personally I'd lose tens of thousands in profits   But knowing that we were a part of exposing the system well it's not worth it - but it's worth something   This will only end in two ways; we all get the greatest payday of our lives I hold 50+ shares currently or we watch the true definition of the end of stock trading for retail traders   The government would then bail us out and buy our stocks at the price we bought them at   So we don't earn any money but we don't lose any money   but the system is shown ,2021-03-18 01:17:06.996567

Except that’s not going to happen no ones gonna spend time and energy to come after you for telling an inconsequential lie  Even if they do it’s not fraud I’m not even sure if it’s illegal but it’s definitely not fraud  What are you defrauding them out of? No judge is gonna hand you a bad sentence for that either if by some miracle you end up there  Here’s a secret most people lie on these and the brokers know this  They don’t care  If they cared they’d implement the most basic of verification system at least,2021-03-18 01:17:14.536024

I don't think you have it correct  Your thesis Is not complete  The reason it will crash the market is that when melvin goes under  Someone still has to pay the longs that would be the clearing house  They will go under but wait the longs still need to get paid  So that falls under the broker  You domino stuff  And once one falls alot will fall  Along with the mass selling it will financially ruin these companies   But it won't stop at the brokers it will hit the whole final system ,2021-03-18 01:18:18.517722

Has this max pain shit ever been right/do any one you use it when buying shit?

Not even toxic just uneducated  They’re brand new to trading  They don’t understand how any of it works or what very much even means  They’re trying to apply “life logic” to the investing world  They don’t understand that you can’t transport your day to day rationale into the stock market  It has to be looked at objectively and emotionless when it’s the only stock they’ve ever held of course they’re going to want it to go to astronomical levels  I don’t blame them  Where I do blame them is when they try to pressure people and manipulate people into buying a stock promising a world of wealth and riches when in reality ashes and dust are just as very probabilistic ,2021-03-18 01:18:35.635998

Yeah I don’t believe 500k-1m/share is in the realm of reality but I do believe this will be the biggest short squeeze in the history of earth    So in my opinion the endgame number will very likely be decided by brokers or the SEC because somebody is gonna shut down this insane party before it’s natural conclusion   What truly worries me is how the institutions will find a way to dump these debts off their books the same way institutions did in 2008 and 2001  It’s been the most consistent tactic from financial institutions since forever they will always do everything they can to make sure they won’t be holding the bag come pay day   So I’m confident that GME holders will make some big gains it’s just the exact number and who is paying that concerns me  If the DTCC covers the final cost and retail investors walk off with a good size bag of money that would be great  I just have a bad feeling it’s gonna get uglier and more complicated than that ,2021-03-18 01:18:57.501208

My understanding that if you have to produce a made up share into a real share by law then the person holding said share can charge whatever they want because you have to provide one  They pay $10000 suddenly that is what each share is worth and up and up it goes,2021-03-18 01:18:57.501671

 1 	⁠I'm under the impression that new documents became available revealing more details about RH's underhanded dealings  2 	⁠If the accepted DD is correct then it won't matter if you are in the middle of a transfer when the MOASS hits  They need your shares to cover and you will have plenty of time to sell  3 	⁠The MOASS has been expected any day for literally months now  Every week there is a new DD out about why it's going to be this week  It hasn't happened yet  This is probably why people are still in RH in the first place - they've been perpetually scared into believing transferring today will cause them to miss the MOASS tomorrow   I can't guarantee that they won't miss the MOASS anymore than you can guarantee that they will  What's important to understand is that regardless of if the new information about RH is correct or not RH is not any investor's friend and they are in cahoots with Citadel and others  Do you really want to keep trusting them with your money?,2021-03-18 01:20:20.562287

Yup   I fully believe in it I'm slightly savant and have spent over a hundred hours researching this stuff   I see three situations:  A: The hedge funds break the shit out of the laws commit complete market manipulation on near untold levels except for the 2008 situation which tanked the US economy and end up paying a hundred million in fines and 1-2 people go to jail for a year or two at club fed as sacrifices   B: The MOASS happens the firms would go into serious red that threatens individuals gauranteed investments and get bailed out by the government to the tune of trillions and we all get paid what we deserve fingers crossed   C: The SEC freezes the stock for a month by the time we can sell it's worthless and we probably get our stocks bought back at the price we bought them at and make no profits but don't lose money   This would show how corrupt and fucked up the system is at it's core that the SEC is on the HF and big firms team and that retail traders have no gaurantees and are left to go fuck themselves and whine about it on the internet and do class action lawsuits that go nowhere other then us NOT losing money   My fear is that it's A or C ,2021-03-18 01:21:09.414646

Since there appears to be a lack of serious answers     The $12 strike for $5 gives you better profits if the stock goes up but the $10 strike for $7 will return more of your money if the stock goes down assuming it's still above the strike price   Since you're buying a call I'm thinking the 12c is probably what you want  If you're not sure about the bet you should either buy the stock instead or sit this one out   Best of luck and godspeed retard  Ook ook ,2021-03-18 01:21:20.864604

I know this will get downvoted to oblivion but there’s just so much wrong information here I couldn’t make it past the third section  But 2 things stand out   First shorting creates synthetic stock  140% of float short doesn’t mean there are any naked shorts  Borrowing a share and then selling creates another position and there’s no limit to how many times a share can be shorted  Let’s say a company has a float of 10 shares and they are all borrowed from group A by hedges and sold to group B  A still has ownership of the 10 they are loaning out but so does B  The SI is 200% of the float   And more importantly it’s absurd to think that a company with a $15 billion market cap can significantly influence the entire market  The S&P 500 alone is worth ~$30 trillion   I would rather have ape donations than some of the crap I’ve seen on here recently  I’m not against GME I’m holding 20 shares  But when FUD hits I want to know that my info is rock solid just like my conviction ,2021-03-18 01:22:59.403547

Whole system being changed so it does not happen again  We may hold a fake share but when we paid real money for it we entered a contract that we would have a real share  They have to turn round and say our contract is null and void and that opens up to worldwide lawsuits and trust in the American stock market disappearing  Government can’t let that happen  Better to pay everyone which would in my guess be the cheaper option and they can fax everyone to the tits from their gains and we will probably all buy lambos and other mental things or re invest which will help off set the cost,2021-03-18 01:23:01.191881

I agree - I mostly believe we'll see them outright cheat blatantly that exposes the system entirely   They pay off maybe under a hundred million in fines have an SEC hearing maybe a couple of big guys at the HF's will be offered up as sacrifices and spend 1-3 years in club fed only to return to their position and a promotion and raise of 7+ figures     And that's just the cost of doing business   But where do we move forward from there?  What changes?  What does the government and the SEC do?  Do Citadel et  al  continue to operate in business?  Is that what shows that the stock market is not for us but for them and the SEC is on their team?     yep   that's what I believe will happen because I've done enough DD to know what should happen if they ddin't cheat ,2021-03-18 01:24:56.275992

I think 1000$ with a squeeze  So it’s about 5  to 6 x current valuation  I would say AMC about 100$ with a subway so about 9-10x current valuation   Both GME and AMC has  gathered worldwide attention   I love GME but I truly believe AMC has a better realistic current valuation 14$ is not bad GME at +200 without a squeeze is overvalued and If you believe it isn’t the you are some special kind of bad retard   GME is not a long term play but a squeeze play that is likely to occur AMC is a long term play and a potential squeeze play ,2021-03-18 01:25:01.473901

"Even with HBO Max offering movies same day on their service I can still see AMC doing well   I honestly think that if someone other than AT&T owned HBO the prices would be much higher for $T as strange as it sounds   Few people realize that AT&T owns HBO and I think the hidden agenda of why John Oliver keeps insulting AT&T is simply so people start to realize this fact   ""Hey guys!?  Umm    buy $T!  Who is $T?  Well that is AT&T!  And AT&T owns HBO Max!""  What do you guys think?  Nonetheless AT&T did not say they were releasing their movies only on their service which is a smart move   And they are not charging extra for them like Disney+   $30 for a movie to watch on a streaming service you are already paying for?  That sounds like a rip-off to me   The high price Disney+ is charging might actually encourage more people to visit the theaters ",2021-03-18 01:25:08.590115

Or it surged because shorts closed    GME has done exactly what one would expect when a short squeeze happens then people randomly think something inexplicable must have caused it instead  It went up from $20 to $400 then to $50 then to $300  How does that not suggest shorts covering?,2021-03-18 01:25:26.362797

 In for xxx positions and HODLing for the long term had a question though   What happens when Melvin and Citadel MnCare bankrupt? Sure the DTCC has to cover the costs   but how does that play out? MnC can't afford to buy anymore shares but they still owe x-million  Does that debt then transfer to the DTCC so they hop on their platform and start buying shares? Is there another process?  I guess the reason why I'm asking this is to work out if it will be business as usual when the squeeze comes bar the regular halts for % hike/drop in short time frame or whether they have a different way of paying that debt  Sorry if I missed a DD somewhere that explains this!,2021-03-18 01:26:36.039319

I would guess from you’re response that you’re a reasonable GME holder and not one of the numerous dickwads the OP is referring to  But I’ll echo what the OP said it’s bad out there  Can’t post literally anything that isn’t GME 🚀🚀🚀 without being called a shill and downvoted off the sub  And I’m playing the GME game myself too but even when I sell a position they go fukn nuts  If they just said their peace but didn’t downvote literally everything else off the sub we could coexist ,2021-03-18 01:26:46.849574

Except they don’t let you go 245k in debt in the first place do you even trade? If you got a margin account they’ll liquidate if you even get close to going in debt  If it’s a cash account it’s literally impossible to lose more money than you have  If you sell 5 contracts you either have to have 500 shares to back it up or in the case of naked they require like 30% the value of the stock x 100 as cash collateral and they’ll auto sell that shit if it even gets close to not being enough,2021-03-18 01:26:49.469953

It’s insane to think that amc will go back to 2017 levels  The whole culture of fear that the media turned covid into has sunk its teeth into peoples psyche  Everyone would rather Netflix and chill so you can bang and get high that’s without the covid hypochondriacs ruining it already  People are far lazier now than ever no way they still go to the theater with the surround sound home theatres they have these days  Plus you gotta wear a mask the entire time? Ha!  Countless countless reasons go against amc being even this high  Their reopening will be pure crap  Nostalgia of getting your first bj at the theater will not be enough  I’m not confident enough to short it because nothing in this market makes sense but all reason goes against amc and gme  But gorillas and rocket ships are the new market  Fuck me im 27 and I feel ancient ,2021-03-18 01:27:46.237936

Personally I think that's the very reason why Fidelity and Vanguard are long on this  They'll be able to meet a lot of their obligation on that alone especially if they unwind just before retail  And while the DTCC is on the hook for payment their recent rule changes suggest that they anticipate having to pay up but can angle for the aforementioned bailout place the legal fallout squarely on Citadel/Melvin/etc and the long institutions that are party to the DTCC go right ahead and collect huge new investment sums from retail   It is hard to believe that anything will be handled fairly given our past but we have to separate what's fair from what's logical  Sometimes those things align sometimes they don't   Logically speaking I don't see a better option for the greatest number of parties involved than to let this squeeze to a number that satisfies retail ,2021-03-18 01:28:09.714873

More the liquidity issue might mean delays in getting paid  Say your brokerage suddenly gets requested for millions of dollars of withdrawals  They don’t have that cash as won’t crash them not their fault as no one not even banks normally keep that good cash flow  Would mean waiting for payment from the carcass of the hedgefund or the government stepping in and paying of the costs and then from the broker to us  That’s my understanding at least  Tell me if I am wrong,2021-03-18 01:28:44.714034

"The top non meme post on this sub just explains what short selling is and why ""a massive squeeze is inevitable"" because of high short interest completely ignoring the fact that SI is much lower than the 140% 'high' quoted in the post",2021-03-18 01:29:01.257341
Honestly it seems like you’re just throwing an extra step in here  Any further dated option is probably going to cost just as much as something deep ITM this week which will pretty much force a hedge  A huge issue with gamma squeezes at these levels is that it costs a ton to do  This week premiums are a lot cheaper compared to last week and that run to 350 seemed to be pure buying pressure  However if you look at OI from 200-250 and 270 you’ll see there could be a decent shot of a squeeze depending on price action for the rest of the week  One big thing I also noticed was that everyone who was deep ITM last week wasn’t really selling which means sentiment is high  And to kindly disagree with OP volume does matter to an extent  Notice how much OI at the 250 and 300 level is and how much volume was there today?

Reading this makes me thinking   Should I borrow 30K from my 401K with 4 25% for 36 months and go yolo on GME in the next few days?  Should I?  I'm already sitting on a few hundred shares but this post makes me realize that every time my personal Fidelity trade with 100% GME go up / down my 401K goes on reverse   So if GME go moon my 401K might as well crash to norhing   Humm thinking    ,2021-03-18 01:29:15.676896

"You didn't read the post       All the brokerages and clearing houses would be bankrupt   where do you think you're going to get the money to be ""rich as hell""?     If you owned call options insurance doesn't cover that so if you had options worth hundreds of millions    wave that money goodbye  It's also likely they would tie this up in court and try to use the ponzi scheme laws around this or something to do with market manipulation to prevent themselves SIPC from making payouts       Best case scenario   you walk away with $500000 from insurance  then you lose half of that to the tax man    good luck       Beyond that if they all went bankrupt that means the financial system would collapse it would tank the market as a whole  Stocks like Apple they'd be screwed  All the foreign money invested in our markets?

Simply put yeah  Someone borrowed shares then that person lent the shares then that person lent the shares  Thats how you get to the astronomical numbers sold short at like 600%+ 800 shares is really 100 sold short 8 times  Kinda like someone kicking a problem down the line to someone else and so on and so forth  Eventually those shares will have to be counted and accounted for and has to go in a reverse borrowing situation where the next person in line needs the shares if 1  Margin call 2  Shares need to be collected and redistributed 3  Someone of higher power has to track down stock  So there has to be really big volatility trending upward or 3rd party intervention to force synthetic shares to accounted for ,2021-03-18 01:30:59.187281

The entire world is invested in Gamestop right now  It would really shake the foundation of the US financial system if they stepped in and said whoopsie  Other countries and investors from around the world would pull their assets from the US exchange because the US Government couldn't keep some hedge funds in line  Honestly letting GME moon would probably be more favourable  People get paid the hedges get their nuts squeezed the government collects billions in taxes the market overall corrects itself the economy booms and the rest of the world doesn't lose confidence in the US financial system         If they pull the plug and bailout the hedges and cause a massive world wide uproar you may have billions in funds being pulled from the stock market to be invested in other markets and that is what crashes the system even more than if they had just let it moon             Sadly no one can predict this  After the January crash I emotionally removed myself from my GME investments  As far as I am concerned that money is gone  If it does squeeze or when GME grows in value over time I will reclaim my inital investment and let the rest ride  Whatever happens happens  Worrying about it will only result in disappointment  History has shown us time and time again the little guy never wins ,2021-03-18 01:31:06.899200

I'll say the same thing I said over at the other subreddit   1 	⁠I'm under the impression that new documents became available revealing more details about RH's underhanded dealings  2 	⁠If the accepted DD is correct then it won't matter if you are in the middle of a transfer when the MOASS hits  They need your shares to cover and you will have plenty of time to sell  3 	⁠The MOASS has been expected any day for literally months now  Every week there is a new DD out about why it's going to be this week  It hasn't happened yet  This is probably why people are still in RH in the first place - they've been perpetually scared into believing transferring today will cause them to miss the MOASS tomorrow   I can't guarantee that they won't miss the MOASS anymore than you can guarantee that they will  What's important to understand is that regardless of if the new information about RH is correct or not RH is not any investor's friend and they are in cahoots with Citadel and others  Do you really want to keep trusting them with your money?,2021-03-18 01:31:13.134960

I've been a GME bull and diamondhander since January but I have some concerns about GME and I want someone to refute them if they can  This is not FUD I want GME to soar I really actually just want someone to convince me my concerns are unfounded   I've read all the DD out there and have taken it into consideration  I think some DD have inaccurate or misleading info and overall having read all the DD I'm still not currently convinced on the bull case   My concern is we don't know whats going on at all the most we have is guess work  Our theory is a long whale triggered the price increase on Feb 24th and has been on our side since but they could take profits and dip any time and we won't know  Volume is an indicator long whales are involved Last Wednesday was the most bullish day for price action before the major short attack  Since then we haven't seen volume to indicate long whales are involved   Last Friday a ton of options were set to go ITM if price closed above 300 it would've added a ton of buy pressure and possibly trigger gamma squeeze  We were so close probably would've made it with volume and GME was on SSR list  Yet somehow that volume never came whales let it close below 300   This week we saw a pretty significant price drop from 280 to 200  Still no volume  I bought more in anticipation of stimmy boost but that seemed to barely make a dent   Tomorrow GME is off SSR and will probably be shorted more   My fear is that long whales have dipped and/or funds are playing retail for a pump and dump and squeeze case is no longer present which could be the case if they did already cover or are covering with synthetic shares -- note that interest borrow rate is super low why? does anyone have the answer? with the premise that while retail things there is still a squeeze cash funds are pumping then dumping on us taking profits each time   I thought about exiting 1/5 of my shares today just to take some profit recover a minimum amount of my cost and maybe buy back in lower tomorrow when and if it dips which many knowledgeable people think it will  I didn't end up doing it  I hope I don't regret it but overall I'm nervous   On the one hand catalysts do exist like earnings call and potential catalysts like Ryan Cohen CEO announcement or board vote to recall shares but none of those things are certain and on some level its surprising to me they didn't already recall shares  We're kinda coasting on blind faith at this point   What would make the most sense for me to mitigate risk would be to sell enough to recover my cost basis and play with casino money which many have done  But on a deeper level I do still really want this to moon and moon with maximum amount of shares I can have on hand   If someone is able to refute my concerns please do ,2021-03-18 01:31:54.093660

What can make short squeezes volatile and specifically scary for brokers is because it doesn’t hit 1k in the snap of a finger  It’s incredibly unlikely that You will wake up one day and see the market open with GME at 1k right out the gate  It rises very rapidly but it still rises over time   That rise isn’t a problem for GME holders they just gonna hold their shares and watch it rocket up and wait for the time to cash in    What makes it scary is the buying action as the price goes nuclear  We all know GME isn’t actually worth $500$600$700$800 a share but there will be people trying to hop on as it takes off and that’s when it’s dangerous for everybody and the capital required from brokers to facilitate all these buy/sell actions during the explosion would be crazy and Idk if the brokers are prepared for that kind of work because we have never seen a squeeze like this,2021-03-18 01:32:26.689932

It seems as though you're assuming ALL $GME stocks will be held continuelly and simultaneity without selling  This is not true  People organizations investors HF's MM and others will sell on the way up for a variety of reasons  Not all 70M shares of GME will be held into the 100k sphere  Many will be sold before   And one other thing- the DTCC is insured at $70 Trillion  So if the HF and all their associates securities and insurance policies fail the DTCC will roll in and pay each share holder his asking price no questions asked because they'll need EVERY SINGLE SHARE   So stop your fear mongering and dooms day predictions  Go outside for a walk  Watch a movie  Have a drink  Smoke a cigarette  Smoke a joint  Go to sleep  Take a shower  Call you mom  Beg your wife's boyfriend to let you in to watch the game   Do whatever you need to do to keep your mental health in a good place because posts like this aren't healthy   And before you accuse me of not reading the post I read every single word you wrote with the due respect I give to every post I read here and I still think that what you wrote is utter horse shit  ,2021-03-18 01:32:57.578560

I took the weekend off from all GME threads and I sold first thing monday morning at $265  I don't have any opinion on what people want to do with their money  But for me it was eye opening to see how badly I was being effected by just reading those threads  And I even knew it before hand  I had taken a way bigger position than I should have and sold it shortly after because I felt like it was stupid and I was sticking my neck out  But I still held  I had averaged myself up to $211 a share from the god damn FOMO I got in those threads  When I sold I may as well have just held my first three shares and sold I had eaten into my own position so badly  And funny enough I had been reading up and doing my due diligence on UWMC for weeks  When I sold I bought into that and put in a lot more money than I had in GME  I made more money today than I would have on GME if it went to $400  Not that it matters anyway with the attitude I got from those fucking threads I wouldn't have sold  Hold and buy whatever you want but take a step back from it for a couple of days and form your own opinions on exactly what you are doing with your money ,2021-03-18 01:33:41.415704

I'm no financial analyst but Chipotle revenue is growing steadily and Gamestop revenue was flat for years and is now declining pretty sharply they also haven't managed to turn a profit since Q2 2018  So I think it's fair to say Chipotle has better fundamentals as a business    If you are sold on the technical argument for the MOASS than by all means keep holding it if that pans out the fundamentals don't matter  Just don't talk yourself into thinking this is a value or a growth stock    CMG vs GME revenue plot for reference:   [Stock Comparison Tool | MacroTrends]https://www macrotrends net/stocks/stock-comparison?s=revenue&axis=single&comp=GME:CMG,2021-03-18 01:33:43.510044

Here's my question:  When we're talking capping and fines    is there any chance above 0 that the government would ever be willing to shut the funds down and force them into liquidation?  Not chapter 11   7   In the past any time the government tries to levy a fine large enough to actually cause any firm financial heartburn they astroturf a few 'citizen action groups' to make noise about 'big government' and they get it shut down   That's why Goldman Sachs can repeatedly and openly do things that net it $5 billion in profit here and there then admit no wrongdoing and pay $10 million fines and you STILL hear people saying that it is unimaginable the government could take that much money away from a private entity   I really don't foresee them rolling in and saying 'we've capped the debt at your assets   Liquidate everything turn it over to retail '  Sure retail would turn around and buy all those valuable stocks at rock bottom prices and it would be beautiful but that's precisely why they won't do it ,2021-03-18 01:35:55.043381

I already answered in my other comment why you won’t go that deep in debt in the first place but let me answer the rest of the shit you’re pulling out of your ass   If you do go into debt billionaire or not you can tell the exchange to fuck itself  What are they gonna do? Send a PI to your house? They don’t know anything about you  They didn’t ask for proof  They can throw you in jail for being in debt to them  There’s nothing they can do to even figure out what your net worth is which is precisely why their risk management system is so robust that it’s impossible to go into debt    Tldr: you’re a moron who has no idea what he’s talking about  You didn’t even know fraudulent representation requires injury  You don’t even know that they don’t let naked selling of options requires enormous amount of collateral  If you want to be a good boy and play everything by the book to get good boy pets on the head go ahead  Almost everyone else isn’t doing that  I’ll happily wait here and see a single instance of such crime reported anywhere,2021-03-18 01:36:29.778394

Sorry if this has been answered already but what’s stopping brokers from simply halting trades again like in January and keep halting them whenever there’s a fear of a large squeeze? If halting trades for one day was enough to send the stock into free fall what’s stopping them from using this ability over and over again until the shorts cover their positions?,2021-03-18 01:36:47.650415

Yeah sure as hell would have made sense to ‘find’ that share when they were dirt cheap though right? Say I went on RH and unknowingly purchased an IOU share for 225 in late January and then RH later ‘find’ it on 18th Feb for 40 59?

Yeah I know it was just one example for guidance in the earnings call   Because the reason they dropped 5% after earnings in December was because their was a lack of guidance moving forward despite blowing out their estimates   And also since it's down 13% from that last earnings call there's less risk that this thing plummets after earnings again,2021-03-18 01:37:58.015107

I don't understand this:   **There are no retail brokers in America that will be capable of paying out retail investors when GME reaches the peak so we will see January 28th happen all over again **   Brokers just connect buyers with sellers   If the price spikes to 5000 that means that people are willing to buy at that price and when you sell your share the buyers broker ponys up the money to do so and your broker ponys up your share   The broker has little risk   All the BS of the settlement houses and 3 6 Billion bill from Vlad was smoke   If someone is offering to buy your share you can sell it   There's a reason Vlad didn't stop sell orders he knew that would invite a massive lawsuit ,2021-03-18 01:38:15.302844

"> How does one get elected to this committee? Fail a finance test?  The sad reality is that the vast majority of politicians are not very smart  To make matters worse most of the career politicians who get to sit on and chair committees have never worked a ""real"" job in their life and have little understanding of the world   As a software developer who has worked in a variety of companies in a variety of industries over the last 20 years I have gained some domain knowledge on a variety of topics  When I see elected officials talk about any of these topics they tend to be dangerously ignorant   For example I developed software for managing equity awards at a previous job which gave me a ton of information on a wide variety of topics in finance  While I am far from an expert I would almost guarantee that I know more than 95% of politicians who will legislate and regulate these markets ",2021-03-18 01:39:04.064011
"Damn man  I am really sorry to hear that  I can't believe you didn't get a pay out  Did your insurance cover it? Get s replacement?  If you're up for a story on the transaction i'll tell anyone that could possibly appreciate it:  Bought my bike Monster 800 back in 2009  Never cleaned her  Did regular maintenance on her and she was always reliable  Had kids job changed with a longer commute 6 years of not regularly riding went by  Somewhat neglected and i know the worst thing for a vehicle is for it to sit  Got the ""you need to sell that"" talk from the wife and knew it was time to do so   I spent the past few weeks doing maintenance on it and chasing down random issues  New engine belts battery plugs flush fluids fuel filter + run some cleaner through clean chain etc  A few issues left but nothing major; cracked plastics some rusty screws where i shoulda put stainless for modifications etc   Listed it on FB yesterday not mentally computing that stimulus would hit today   At 9 AM a guy is blowing up my FB saying 'wow your bike looks badass I want to do something special for my step son and buy it for him and I want to buy it today ' Weather forecast in my region was for heavy rain and severe weather all day so i told the guy to wait a day or two and we'll meet up then  He insisted and said he had cash and would pay asking price so i told him to come on over but he should trailer it or something  He tells me he lives 50 miles away and he's on his way and his step son will ride it home  In the rain  50 miles   Guy pulls up in a old Fusion with dented in doors riding on a donut  Expired tags  An older man gets out of passenger seat and a very young man gets out of the drivers seat  I notice the old man is drunk but the young man seems nice  I show them the bike and the older man tell me it looks badass and to fire it up  I explain that the bike is cold and they will see that it starts on first crank cold and that just goes way over their head  I explain the fast idle fuel injected lever and start it up and the older man grabs the throttle and cranks it and bounces it off the limiter  It dies and I say maybe lets not do that when the bike is cold  Explain everything on the bike i show them all the aftermarket parts parts I've replaced show them an aftermarket exhaust that I took off because its too loud explain shes italian and needs love and she'll love you back and they're just like yeah man cool  Ducati is Italian? I thought it was Japanese  Shit  I tell them if they want to ride it they give me asking price in cash and I hold it for the test ride and if we need to negotiate we can do so afterwards  Older man says no need to negotiate we're buying this bike it's badass  They pull out a wad of cash which i now assume are counterfit 100s and hand me asking price   The younger man tries to back it down the driveway and gets stuck  Then he puts it in gear and rides it through my yard which is mud and soaked with water  Gets it on the road and takes off    He comes back after 5 minutes managing to not drop it as far as I know and they're like yeah man write it up we're buying it  I have pre filled out bill of sales documents ask them to fill out 2 copies  The older man fills it out  He writes ""First name"" with address of ""Town""  Names and locations removed   I'm getting heartburn as I realize I'm sending my bike off to it's agonizing death   The younger man has obviously never done anything mechanical in his life and I exllained to him and the older man that the valves need to be inspected and the belts need to be replaced every two years  Younger man said what is a valve tried to give a 10 second internal combustion engine primer and then a desmo primer but to no avail  I then said take it to a mechanic every 2 years to do maintenance   The younger man then gets a phone call it's his baby momma  He has a 1 year old  He is 22  He is arguing with her and says I'm buying this motorcycle and you can't stop me  Older man says man my wife is gonna kill me  Young man hangs up tells me his roommatewhat is good with bikes and has a harley and he can fix whatever needs to be fixed when time comes   Then it hits me  These people got their stimulus checks today and ran to the bank and cashed it out  Money now has no real value to them and want just whatever they want  They are here buying this 18 year old motorcycle for my asking price and its because they just got this free money  This bike is going to be kept outside to rust away the left of its horrible life  Something small will breakthat prevents proper operation and it will not get fixed and she will languish until she i don't even know what will happen   Baby momma calls back someone needs to pick uo their son because she's at a doctor's appointment   He has to call someone to pick up his son  Then he asks me where a parking lot is that he can keep his car while he rides the motorcycle back  I tell him he can park it outside the front of my house but why? Older man tells me he doesn't have his drivers license and he is drunk so they need to come back and get the fusion later   Young mans sister comes and picks up older man  Car is bashed in on the side  They move an open 12 pack of Bud from the fusion to the sisters car    Young man takes off on motorcycle in the rain with no helmet a sweatshirt and no glasses   Fusion is still in front of my house   I have a wad of cash   What is happening   I'm freaking out a bit   Will probably delete this later ",2021-03-18 01:39:04.064280

" One must be really dumb thinking that everyone will hold up until 1mil    As I see it no one is selling now but whenever we start to moon a lot of people will start to jump off the rocket at 1k 5k 10k 15k 25k 50k 100k etc leaving just small portion of apes at the top of the squeeze   Even if these people actually hold till then I'd assume they sell majority early and just leave a few shares to see ""if it even goes there""   Thus while maybe he's right on 100k not everyone will demand 100k  From what I understand everyone gets what they want  If they want 10k cool that's what they get  If i want 1mil that's also cool as they have to buy it anyways and that's how much they will pay   And thus this whole DD is worth shit because it assumes everyone is a diamond handed ape holding up until 100k/1mil  No people will bail out that's a fact  But it doesn't change HF position needing to buy a fuckton of shares making **our** prices a reality ",2021-03-18 01:39:16.985846

This would have been good dd if you posted it months ago when the short interest actually was at 140% and before the squeeze  Gme went up 8000% since last year you missed the big one  If it goes from 200 to 1000 big whoop 500% is nothing compared to what its already done ,2021-03-18 01:40:20.130714
99% of HOAs are absolute horse shit  You're literally paying them money for them to tell you how to run your own house and maybe hire out for a little snow removal which doesn't matter depending on where you live  No decent person wants to be on the Board for an HOA  Its all a power trip,2021-03-18 01:40:20.130851

Why would they feel the need to intervene? The S&P just hit another all time high  I'm of the opinion that this entire post is completely ridiculous but if GME ever got big enough to the point where it threatened the rest of the market the SEC would freeze it so fast ,2021-03-18 01:40:21.854034
Short ratio is 41% down from 144% but suddenly nobody wants to believe the new number  Even though they believed 144%    https://www highshortinterest com  There are several other stocks above 30% so I’m not sure why GME is still the big target ,2021-03-18 01:40:24.414734
There is no fucking target that's the point  Quit the LARPing and either try to make money or go   And this is not ignorance you genuinely don't understand what this place this ,2021-03-18 01:40:24.414882

Gonna buy another 8000 shares  Long all the way,2021-03-18 01:40:29.333171
I have a number of shares less than 5  The plan for me is to sell one when it covers cost of investment and see what happens from there  I'm not stupid enough to think this ever hits 100k and if it does I'll have sold well before then  80k would pay off my house  100k takes care of my car too  Holding beyond that is just begging to screw me out of a financial independence I can't even imagine right now  50k a share would be fucking amazing but even just being able to pay off my house would be life changing and I can do that at a much lower number so why wouldn't I? Sure I could HOPE for higher but more than likely I get screwed one way or another  Either missing the peak or government intervention   I see either as possible   In other words    I'm guessing 100k is just a meme much as everyone insist otherwise  We have families to feed and homes to pay for  Much as we insist we are dumb most of us I hope know better and that reality has to come first ,2021-03-18 01:40:29.977368

You had significantly less possibility of anyone who had a share selling it  VW owned so much of it and mutual funds owned the rest  That's as diamond hand as you could ever get ,2021-03-18 01:41:33.949721

To me it seems like limiting margin makes sense limiting options makes sense even limiting selling makes sense    but buying a share basically by definition can not incur greater risk than the price of the share and in order to buy a share you have to provide your broker with MORE capital while selling involves the broker giving their capital to you   So    when you're skinny on capital and decide to limit the one way your customers have of giving you more money preventing them from doing something that simply cannot increase your risk profile    wtf?,2021-03-18 01:42:02.424148

This is the most dense take ever  You really think the SEC will allow the entire market to crash by 50% because some retail kids caught hedges with their pants down?   Spoiler alert won’t happen  They will absolutely leave this in the laps of the share holders  They will extend the deadlines for shorts to cover  They’ll do every illegal thing necessary so their 401ks don’t get cut in half  And there’s not a god damn thing you or I can do about it unless you’re willing to go French Revolution on their asses ,2021-03-18 01:42:13.036258

Naked calls/puts if fidelity has fraud stops to help protect then from this it's not because their trying to protext you it's so they don't have to deal with the headache that comes afterwords and the money they'll lose  Fact of the matter is that it is possible with things like uncovered puts and shorted puts and people have been caught because of this shit its a huge deal and you just got to go look at Google for examples and these things DO happen and its illegal for a God damn reason those auto sells aren't there to stop you from going into debt it's there to stop fidelity from having to cover your dumb ass  Fraudulent stops are there to stop fraud and people have found workarounds for these things so brokerages have to cover all their bases doesn't mean what you're doing isn't illegal it just means they are one step ahead to stop you from ruining their business and causing more of a headache for then,2021-03-18 01:43:42.045783

A lot has happened since January also i don't see how RH can just buy loads of shares at $38 and just keep hold of them judging by the DD they only have to buy shares if people who are selling are in profit  Most people do unfortunately not make profits in retail but i think January was unique that the gamma squeeze happened so they couldn't afford to settle hence the DD they got margin called and needed a 3b bailout ,2021-03-18 01:45:08.519835

I mean options that are close to expiration are a great way to throw away money  But the premium you pay for them is based on some greeks and the implied volatility  So obviously the ones that are statistically less likely to pan out will be cheaper and leaves a hell of a lot more room to be far more profitable    You're actually still negative as far as yours go at least in after hours trading    Your break evens are 10 75 and 10 95  So at the moment it would make more sense for someone to buy shares than your options off of you  However the call options themselves have value before their expiration and that's increased which isn't quite the same as if you were to exercise them right now ,2021-03-18 01:45:25.174587

A fucking shit load is the answer  Nobody smart enough to have 50000 in the market is dumb enough to hold past those numbers and there goes most of the retail  Those whales make up most of retail shares of GME  You can do whatever you want with your money I don't want to see you lose it  It's the small fish that are gonna get fried ,2021-03-18 01:45:52.215398

That can sometimes work but it's already admitting that he is trying to salvage a losing trade  Not everything is about assignment risk if he rolls up and out it's not going to make him much money while obligating him for a longer period of time  Might just be better off taking the loss and moving on   Looking at the options chains if he had 3/26 calls  3/26 $250 c has an ask of $34 00 while 4/1 $300 c has a bid of $29 25  So if he wanted to roll out right now he would have to roll out multiple weeks just to have a net gain in premium   Lets also look at what a $50 roll out looks like for options at the money  The 3/26 $210 c has an ask of $48 30 while the 4/1 $260 c has a bid of $37 40  So again he has to roll out multiple weeks just to stay positive  4/9 $260 c is $46 55 bid which we can call close enough if he can get a fill between the bid/ask spreads in one or both parts of the rollout  For reference the 1/20/23 $260 c has a bid of $106 00 45 times the duration for only double the price   So $50 has to roll out 2 weeks to break about even maybe turns a tiny profit if he can get good fills  What do you suppose happens if GME rises by $50 or more each week? In this situation time decay is basically in reverse since the further he rolls out the less value time is adding to the contract  So no he can't just roll up and out forever  The only way that strategy works is if you can roll out above the max price or the price rises slower than you can roll out  If the price rises too quickly he will roll out so far that he is guaranteed to be holding those contracts when the squeeze happens ,2021-03-18 01:45:58.391762
This made me think about Nassim Taleb and Victor Niedehoffer  The guys basically knew that eventually something cataclysmic would happen to the market and built investment strategies around it  Mathematically they were 100% correct  Statistically you are more likely to make a ton of money by betting against the market until a cataclysm happens than you are to make a ton of money guessing right time and time again or assuming the market will just continue to grow  The problem is math doesn’t matter when the money doesn’t actually exist and in the situation where you are supposed to get it entire banks completely dissolve  Neither of these guys made billions in 2007 and I’m afraid the same will be true for a lot of people with skyrocketing shares of GME for the same reasons  Being “right” isn’t worth a lot when winning means almost everyone else loses  Let’s be real it’s not just hedge funds that are at risk here  There are 401Ks pension funds and equity positions for almost every company not under water  Will some HFs die in the squeeze? Probably  Will the government etc  step in and “save” the market before everyone pays out and crashes the whole market? Absolutely ,2021-03-18 01:46:00.383470

> I do not care what broker you have fidelity E*TRADE Schwab or robinhood etc  They are gonna be forced to shut down GME buys and very possibly sells just like RH did on January 28th  When the number spikes again nobody will have the liquidity to move the money required for the MOASS  This is exactly why I am out   I was in I believed I read everything I possibly could about this and I just don't have conviction that the system itself won't fuck me out of my money to protect itself   People here think that the markets are going to allow share prices to go to $500000 a piece before regulators or corruption intervenes?   They didn't even it let it get to $500 before they completely changed the rules   I think they'll do it again ,2021-03-18 01:46:04.288127

My plan would be to buy 100 shares  For example if I bought 100 shares at $211 $21100 total I would then immediately sell a covered call at a strike price of $260  The premium for a $260 call expiring 3/26 is $30 68 per share  So I’d immediately get $3068 in cash just off of the premiums on a weekly call  Is basically be getting the 100 shares at a discount although I’d risk the price dropping drastically and not being able to sell until 3/26 ,2021-03-18 01:46:49.166524
Nothing is confirmed everyone has theories  The price at 40-50 was the price right before the squeeze and is still much higher than GME at the start of the year  Likely retailers who missed their chance to take profits at the top so just holding to see what happens  The spike after that was likely caused by a gamma squeeze  And now my -theory- is that people are hoping there is enough short interest/buying pressure from retail to cause more of a short squeeze?,2021-03-18 01:46:51.217244

"Here's the reason why you are wrong about GME not necessairly AMC:  When chewy was launched there were relatively few online competitors   They were started in 2011 and in 2014 online pet supply sales were only 7% of a the US market the current US market for the pet industry is \~100B   It's now 2021 and online pet supply sales is still under 50% but they chewy have like 40% of that market   There is still a ton of upside for e-com   Videogames in the US are a smaller market still huge but closer to 60B   Games themselves are 80%+ digital sales to begin with as of 2018 and consoles have very little if any profit margin controllers and accessories are where it's at   Good luck to a B&M store trying to take you to the moon   Cohen is going to transform GME and make them not get owned by amazon how?  We can already buy the software directly from MS/Sony/Nintendo/Steam/etc     I'm not sayin that there isn't room for a B&M hybrid online GME going well into the future   But that certainly isn't a growth company unless they start giving handies in the back alley   GME is going to have a MUCH tougher time regardless of what Cohen does to ""break into"" the online gaming market   I just ordered some dog food from Chewy yesterday and I have ordered from them in the past before they dropped the brand origen that I feed my dog previously   I then ordered from Amazon and/or petflow for literally exactly the same price with the same service   I think Chewy is great   Chewy solves a problem for me: I can't find the brand of food I want outside a few speciality stores that I have to go out of my way to get to   On the other hand I buy a new console every 5 years along with an extra controller or two   That's the only phyiscal purchase I need to make and frankly I don't think GME will make that process better than anyone else   Furthermore they bundle stupid shit with them around launch time to upsell you good for them so why the hell would I go there   In conclusion unless GME is going to give M$ Sony Nintendo and the various independent game studios that produce console and PC games UNLIMITED handies for discounts on their games so that they can sell them cheaper and still make a profit when those above companies are literally doing all they can to kill phyiscal media cut out the middle man GME and more efficiently make profits themselves I'm not convinced   Two controllers a charging tower and some misc $17 chinese accessories every 5 years isn't going to take you to the moon   But it did turn Cohen's $76 mil investment into $1 4B   Perhaps he was listening to DFV   Note: I'm not hating on trading GME to make tendies above and I honestly think you should hold it if you have it now   But when you start talking about Cohen and fundimentals you derail the moon journey   The moon journey is because Apes together strong not because GME is a sound fundimental buy   They were undervalued when DFV spotted them and started talking about them certainly   And there is $ to be made by trading them   But they are a squeeze rally momentium IV play not a sound fundimental investment   They aren't Chewy   They are competing directly with studios who have their own distribution and the console makers themselves who control the casino   Chewy was competing with Petsmart lol ",2021-03-18 01:47:53.519153

Actually using your example as per their logic if Elon Musk originally had nothing to do with PayPal and still had all this success with Tesla THEN become the lead for PayPal   yeah I can see PayPal at least doubling from where it is right now  Because everyone knows who Elon Musk is and what he's capable of  The market would instantly value PayPal at a MUCH higher market cap   If anything we can say that since Musk was on the PayPal team and PayPal is about $250bn market cap right now Tesla should be at least that too  Well Tesla is double that and then some   $GME to 2xCHWY confirmed 🚀🚀🚀,2021-03-18 01:48:40.137774

Couldn't GME themselves unwind this entire squeeze and pocket the money in order to fund the business for years to come by simply issuing more stock?  Think about it if they are short 140% and Gamestop issues enough shares to dilute shares by say doubling the number of shares issued and sold the new shares at $50/ea or even $200/ea basically all the shorts can exit the money flows to GME the market wide crash you are saying could happen is diffused   If you are right wouldn't the SEC push for GME to do this to unwind the squeeze rather than let the atomic bomb go off?,2021-03-18 01:52:28.259177

Yeah it could if we bought like they do  They move the price 15 or 20 dollars with dump volume of 200K shares  200K/9 million wsb =  022 so it would only take 3% of wsb to do that but unless retail got last tick there would be a counter attack to fight off ,2021-03-18 01:52:46.464761

So let's say they are shorting $GME  Who's to say they didn't open up a short when the stock was at $400  If that happened cover what? Cover a massive profit?     At this point short interest is basically meaningless  When you have a stock price at $4 yeah it can mean a whole lot  When you have a stock that's gone from 4 to 40 to 518 to 172 to 300 to 200     it means nothing ,2021-03-18 01:52:51.841088

They've given up on the shitty knockoff controllers and it looks like they are pretty much dedicated to making PC peripherals  The mouse they make looks okay and seems to sell pretty well in china  The ticker I mentioned is selling at less than half a cent which is why I am trying to figure out if that ticker is associated with the current Mad Catz  Id say it would be worth a whole lot more if it manages to come back and attract gamers in places like china/south korea ,2021-03-18 01:53:14.787313

"Don't get mad this is just speculation for funzies not what i think will happen   If there were an untenable amount of shorts and a MOASS was guaranteed to happen   If i were a hedgefund/MM what I would do is try to get the government on board to freeze the stock for buying or sellilng in order to ""protect"" the american economy from ""collapse"" and then I would have them force Gamestop to issue additional stock to cover the short amounts paid out at lets say $500 per share arbitrary number   Gamestop gets a huge infusion of cash and does large dividend payments while keeping a large amount of that cash on hand   Gamestop stock holders get a settlement of $100 per share for those holding at the time of the freeze they get to keep their stocks due to the shorts purchasing the new issued stock from GME and returning any borrows and covering synthetic shares   then the stock price goes up to whatever the market decides for GMEs new valuation  Over the next few years Ryan Cohen turns the company completely around and becomes a huge player in the video game industry due to providing an experience and care that the customer can't get elsewhere     Those who were left holding the bag but kept the stock long term would become rich as Ryan Cohen has brought huge growth to the company   Thus making true diamond hands rich   The END  &#x200B;  Not financial advice Its just a fun exercise to pass the time   Do your own DD make your own decisions and eat your own crayons",2021-03-18 01:54:45.558268
Well that depends if you're going for a short play vs a long play  Each APHA share turns into 83 81% of a TLRY and right now APHA is the cheaper of the two giving a discounted TLRY  That's my hedge against if APHA doesn't boom  But the two have basically been linked in movements and they're both going to potentially boom leading up to the merger  If it doesn't go above $100 I'm just holding long-term due to the newly merged Tilray being the largest weed company in the world  Literally can't go wrong unless the merge doesn't happen,2021-03-18 01:54:45.558555

The banks don't cover the fact they can't pay and the govt might bail them out  Or they claim bankruptcy and we don't make a mil per share   Citadel has 35 billion in assets  I'm not sure what the short % is currently  But something like 5k to 6k per share causes them to go bankrupt from previous data/posts I've seen   I've only a general idea of what can happen and the likely play that will  But there's been so much fuckery already its hard to say honestly   I just know it's not going to collapse the economy only the market which will correct itself and the likely hood of us reinvesting a portion of earnings will likely be high ,2021-03-18 01:55:04.852012

In all honesty I only want the tendies because I can’t afford to take care of my parents my husband was just diagnosed with EOPD and I have three kids  I and every single person in my world have worked since we could drive and we are all dying without ever living  60hrs/week of all of our lives are spent working our bodies to death and barely making it and I’m so fucking tired man    It’s not fun and it’s not a game and this experience has taught me more about the truth of our society than anything up to this point  Money is fucking fake  It’s a concept  It’s tiny little shares of power and there are a tiny few who are hoarding them and I’m so fucking tired of it    I’m not scared I’ll lose my money  I’m 40yrs old with a family  I played with what I could afford to lose  But god   imagine what I could gain! I could pay for life prolonging treatment for my husband  He’s only 40 too  All of this is so sick    I’m hodling    I’m buying the dips because I really truly like GameStop  I have a 19yr old and was a single mom for the first 8yrs of his life  I couldn’t afford anything at full price but I could go there  I got him his first sonic game there and ten years later [this]https://imgur com/a/pKG6hHt is what he’s doing    No one has coerced me or told me to do anything    The only things that ANYONE on this sub has done is TEACH me and support me and also troll me but that’s to be expected    But it is so not a game anymore  They could have done the right thing   but they doubled down and are making money off of us as they continue to lie and cheat and buy more and more and more what? What are they buying that is so important that they have to have that much money? Are aliens coming? Like seriously guys   wtf?,2021-03-18 01:55:59.070010

Traders on the literal floor will represent your sentiments   If your broker sells before you are ready the broker is likely protected by your agreement   If you are on margin or fractional shares it is their right   Whole Share Brokers will very rarely betray their customers   If you wish to sell a good bit at market or slightly lower they will literally travel to match your ask with a buyer if they deem the amount worthy   In my case I’d be left with at best the shoulder at worst the low of the underlying price   I’m willing to accept that   So far as a coordinated effort yes   I’ve seen it 2 to 5 times per week for about 3 months now   The share price gets driven down for no reason other than repeating sells at the ask   Those efforts are part of the reason many GME longs now believe the stock will reach $10-$100k   Retail investors by and large believe in this cause   A very few retail investors short   By and large hedge funds short at every opportunity   If this doesn’t clue you in bye   I eat crayons semi-professionally   I have no desire to engage in ideological discourse   This is not financial advice you smooth-brained apes   This is not financial advice you dumb sack of shits   I am not a financial advisor   I do not offer financial advice   I have no clue if the market or a security will go up or down   Or sideways   I just want my lunchbox full of crayons!,2021-03-18 01:56:09.138619

Everything at your own risk man  No one truly knows if this stock is gonna squeeze  All we can do is speculate on the hedge fund positions  My personal non financial advisor advice would be to wait a bit and see what happens with the stock; because it seems we've lost a lot of momentum recently  That could very well change though and quickly  We've seen it happen multiple times now  But if you do go in make sure you only put up money that you would be ok with never seeing again  But if this does squeeze there might not be any opportunity to earn this stupid of an amount of money ever again ,2021-03-18 01:56:30.070353

The Hulu thing is   It's a mixed bag   They never mention the VW squeeze which was probably to make Cramer sound somewhat credible when he was implying anyone who held beyond $350 was an idealogue with an axe to grind   They also let Cramer repeat unchallenged the lie that the shorts covered their positions and they made out like it was all over and done with     but at the very end had to include that by March 8th the price had already recovered to above the market close on Jan 28th   They showed several people who made out well on the trade and one single paper handed dude who sold at a loss on Jan 28th who I imagine didn't know he was going to be the only one included who lost any money and probably feels crappy about it ,2021-03-18 01:58:33.728292
I can see the cost advantage there  I was thinking of swinging the trade not really holding for a long term play mainly because I didn't do a deep DD just a look at some charts and the catalyst coming tomorrow  I may have to reconsider my plan though thanks for the insight ,2021-03-18 01:58:35.325077

The problem with DD on GME in general right now is that it's all backwards facing which is to say someone starts with a thesis and then looks at the data to prove that thesis  This is the *opposite* of how good DD should work   Good DD should actively set out to disprove a theory in order to bolster its validity   Instead we have a lot of people making very logical and well-reasoned conclusions that are unfortunately built on a basic underlying misunderstanding of a fundamental component   Take your example of institutions liquidating other holdings to cover the interest expenses  At one point in time pre February that was a very valid thesis because the interest was legitimately strangling  It's not at all right now -- it's very low  It's certainly not the reason hedge funds are converting assets ,2021-03-18 01:59:21.937399

"Honestly this sub has gotten QAnon levels of culty around GME  As someone who's been here a looong time it's honestly a bit upsetting   Anything that's posted that isn't overly bullish on GME is attributed to bots and bad faith actors  Any time the stock drops its hedge funds manipulating the market  The amount of posts that make the front page that don't understand how the market works or are just completely detached from reality is astounding   I feel I'm completely wasting my time trying to explain to people why a $10k price target for GME is unrealistic   I know it's easy to say ""we're just having fun"" or ""it's just memes"" but there are a lot of inexperienced people making decisions with their money based on what they read here   It's way too easy to find evidence to back up a belief you already have  I'm bullish on GME right now but we shouldn't down vote people when they present a bear case  Having that alternative perspective and challenging your already held beliefs is important so that when things do change you are left clinging to your old ideas   Basically stop using the down vote as an ""I don't like this"" button ",2021-03-18 02:00:15.827524

I dont know how that would play out but   its dangerous to do it on a friday with expiring ITM calls tho since people will want to sell those back rather than exercise which would stop the Gamma since the hedgies could use those shares for another call or sell   Once the momentum dies the shorts could jump in quickly and push it down further   I could see the reason for doing it is the delta would be so low due to the expiring calls on friday but I think it would be smarter to do it on a thursday so people were more likely to hold on to their calls once they get ITM on thursday   not financial advice,2021-03-18 02:01:21.544328

It is created by purchasing futures contracts that are expect to lose value over time  So you will lose many over time  That's my basic understanding of it   Look at the max time chart and you can see it used to be valued much higher than it's current value relatively speaking  I think maybe they just keep adjusting the stock quantity to keep it reasonably priced 🤷‍♂️   If you look up cantango it gives a better explanation ,2021-03-18 02:01:39.281051

$500K probably even $5K would bankrupt the entire system  The people that run the system won’t let that happen  They’ll just shut it down again and maybe pay some SEC fines   You can’t actually win the casino in a casino  Eventually they just throw you out if you’re winning too much ,2021-03-18 02:04:33.189178

You're correct that retail couldn't pump a stock from 40 to 200 alone but you're creating a false dichotomy between the stock being massively shorted or not shorted at all  If GME is still shorted 20% that's still a notable amount  Not break the market notable but still enough to support a drive up to 300 like we've seen  You're also not accounting for the snowball effect of GME being in the spotlight  It's perfectly plausible people jumped on board again precisely because they thought there was another squeeze happening regardless of whether that's true or not and that drove the stock up again too    This isn't to say the lower short percentage is accurate but the mere fact that we've seen another surge certainly doesn't mean the stock's still up near 100% SI ,2021-03-18 02:04:41.428085

Objectively? All you gave was an opinion that the app is cute and people don't give a fuck  What facts are you citing lol? I'm not even purporting that my argument is fact  I have doubts that robin hood will survive if payment for order flow is banned and that ultimately the lack of favorability implies customers will not remain loyal to robin hood in the long run  They're desperate to go public and in order to have a shot at it they need to demonstrate customer retention  Just because you're the first to do it doesn't mean you will be the last  Robin hood is lucky if they get bought out by a major clearing firm that can adapt to the future regulations but that is my OPINION ,2021-03-18 02:05:00.657214

It doesn't have to just affect the portfolios of people who shorted gme   It can cause a chain reaction  If the stocks hedge funds have to sell to cover gme are also owned by people who heavily use margin they run the risk of a margin call      News has been pushing the fear of a market bubble lately and it could be a self fulfilling prophecy   Passive mutual fund investors could get scared sell at already low levels  and healthy hedge funds will short the market like they did in March 2020     But also none of this could happen and any preparation you make could lose money buying worthless puts or miss any market gains by sitting on to much cash      I am trying to figure out what I'm going to do  but I still have no clue   It will probably be something similar to what you suggested  All I know is that I'm going to stay far away from using margin,2021-03-18 02:06:14.841075

"Been in and out of AMRN for a while currently no positions   I might reconsider throwing a little bit at it since the price is low and there is plenty of room for them to turn a profit in the short term   What sours me however is that AMRN's whole drug catalog is this one medication with nothing in the pipeline   Although FDA approved the patent is not secured on this medication and generics could lower sales in the near future   Also there are many patients that take OTC fish oil at MD recommendation currently for prevention and there might not be motivation for these MD to recommend this Rx which is 5-10+ times the monthly cost of OTC even if there is a small benefit of Vascepa over fish oil fish oil can slightly raise bad cholesterol   Getting prescribers on board might be a barrier     That said there are some upsides as well:  Possibility of label expansions is definitely there  AMRN has put significant money into increasing their sales force and advertising both to consumers and professionals   Sales are increasing maybe not as well as similar ""blockbuster"" cardiac preventatives but still not bad    There is a large market     If I were to put some cash into this it would be a short term sort of investment   Best case scenario they get bought in the next year or so for a 30% upside on whatever gains they made since then   More likely scenario they have a couple years of good sales and profitability and then start to peter out maybe they have something new in the pipeline when that happens   Worst case their sales force can't keep up with the generics and the OTC products and this is their peak year for sales   An exit plan should be ready for all these     My opinion only I'm just a science nerd not a financial advisor ",2021-03-18 02:07:41.263400

"Shearing them isn't an option  And animals learn from mistakes or they die  Other hedge funds exist even if this one falls  And this will make them wealthy beyond your dreams  Changing the rules is what we should want  They got to this point because they were abusing the system and retail investors to get where they are  To think we should allow that to continue for the possibility of this exact situation occurring again? Likely once we've all died and they'd had countless more years of taking people's money?

It’s all good  None of us have concrete numbers to work with in regards to GME and short sellers  I feel like that says more about short selling than anything else if any lesson can be learned from this there clearly needs to be more transparency with financial institutions and short selling    I never knew that about broker’s roles in lending their client’s shares so that is a valid point that does affect my conclusion on the 140% float so point taken   However I still believe the current float is not accurate because while it is a large percentage GME’s trends are almost identical to the January squeeze and I just don’t know understand how that could be possible if the shorts actually closed their positions and the float really did drop from 140% to around 20% ,2021-03-18 02:09:21.400595

When GME popped last time where brokers stepped in it barely touched 500 and even then only for a moment  Everyone was taking profits and it crashed within days  If you legitimately think gme will cross 1000$ I feel bad because you're definitely gonna be left holding the bag  Do you think if gme spikes all gazillion of you 'apes' are gonna orderly sell your shares? No it's gonna crash as hard as it spikes and smart money is gonna try to be first to the door to secure profits  All of this 10k isn't a meme talk is so you get left waiting while they get out with their money ,2021-03-18 02:09:25.576772

Yeah nah  You also mentioned in another comment that short interest was meaningless in this scenario  You've completely missed the core argument behind GME and I'm not going to bother to explaining it if you haven't made the effort to do your own due diligence   The post itself was actually good as I thought it reflected my own thesis on what it could mean on a global scale depending on how this plays out   The people didn't bring us into this scenario the institutions did and now they're scrambling to find an exit before it gets to the point of no return ,2021-03-18 02:09:27.374106

Can we open this up to the serious Discussion? Please answer    What makes you think that the HFs are going to let this happen? And what I mean by this is they have the money they have the power  They can continue to borrow shares to bring down the market price when it hits too high    The retail investors only have so much they can buy  We’re dried up we have no more money  That’s why our volume is dropping  HFS are playing the long game  They know if they can last these next two months that the public will get bored and move to the next thing and take their money out    The media isn’t on our side anymore  The last time gme Skyrocketed the media was all over on it  Now they are trying to FUD us to sell even on WSB  We need volume and high high interest  Right now everyone thinks it’s over and done and WSB people are idiots    Let’s say the does happen      you really think Any broker will allow something to happen that will bring a market collapse? If it does happen it’ll go up from 400 to 500 to 600 to 700 quickly and then RH restrictions everywhere  I’m talking no buying market breaks GME stock tickers will show unavailable on all platforms  Etc etc  if you miss the very short lived squeeze you’ll miss out on everything  Government will interfere pause trading and get GME all squared up off the market    Look I want this shit to happen but I doubt we will see the market crumble and people with their hands in their pockets doing nothing to stop it  At the end of the day who has ever gotten bailed out? Regardless of what they’ve done  The Rich big companies  And this time will be no different   They’ll protect the HFs and screw us little guys ,2021-03-18 02:10:42.483774

Since you guys are the big boys I’m curious to ask y’all this: what do you consider “rich”? And I know there are different levels of wealth but what do you think the entry point of that is?

Why wouldn’t you just buy 100 shares at a cost of $169 and have a asset rather than paying 128 per contract and another 50 to exercise?   You are saving  40 on the front end in case it drops below  50?  Even if it drops to  4- 49 you are still in a better situation with the shares   ,2021-03-18 02:11:49.539481

Yes and no  If they shorted again at $400 a gain would be realized but would ultimately still be diminished by their synthetic short value  The shares available in the market are still the same and the short interest until it's probably below 20% would still be a factor  And if gains were had and they minimalized loses it should be easier to pay us for our shares    I'm not saying this hits $100000 or even $10000 but I'm far from opposed because I do hold a position; $1000 is still on the radar   Either way at any rate any of these totals won't send the world into complete chaos even if the apes get $1000 realistically it's only a small victory   I do agree that we would be halted I do believe that things probably won't end in our favor but I like the stock I like my ape brothers and I like the message ,2021-03-18 02:11:49.663342

So apparently we revealed a massive world wide liquidity problem and all the people in the world combined can't some how stop it  Not other hedgefunds not other governments let alone THE United States government  Somehow everyone is incompent not going to see it coming and are competent at the same time?  Other hedgefunds have a stake in GME its obvious and the money just doesn't disappear after it leaves the stock market when the shorts liquidate  The world won't fall apart from one event just like it didn't in 2008 when hedgefunds got bailed out   Most importantly so many rude comments and putting others down when they just want to clarify or learn more about this supposed DD  Clear fear mongering ,2021-03-18 02:12:53.425048

If it’s in response to my comment then I never said the economy would crash even paying everyone what they are owed for the shares would not do that  But governments stepping in to manipulate a stock is not a good sign to the rest of the world  I’m saying people will get paid but yeh not enough to crash the economy  Even 60ish million shares at say $10000 would not dent the value of the US stock exchange  What are you hoping for then if not getting paid?,2021-03-18 02:13:00.332074
Interesting rationale so you think they'll fuck the game up again  My personal take is that is far more dangerous to them to do that especially given January as it deteriorates the little trust left needed to function  Given they don't do that do you think it would stand to go to 500k? After all a short position is open to a theoretical unlimited loss potential no? We could go into the technicals on it but again you're banking that the system will leave people out to dry and technicals don't mean anything in that case right?,2021-03-18 02:13:01.428499

Yoooo thats not even considering the fact that right now institutions themselves own over 100% of the float plus Cohen and boards 20m plus retail   So based off of that because of their overzealous shorting it seems there is a minimum of 140m shares out there that need to be bought back due to the synthetic shares/same share having been borrowed and left out multiple times over   And thats the conservative theory of SI% ,2021-03-18 02:13:27.115581

So yeah that’s kind of what I’m getting at  There is a very small subset of people that would even put it into these stocks to begin with  But beyond that the money didn’t just magically arrive to everyone on the same day  It is being filtered in over the course of many many months so when people say things like “Wednesday is the day it hits!” you should know they are idiots because that’s not how any of this works ,2021-03-18 02:14:56.340505

This is a very interesting read but I do have three questions for both you OP and everyone else capable of weighing in   1 Provided the MOASS occurs let's assume in late April per your estimate for argument sake what prevents sellers from being left holding the bag over the sheer weight of this bill? Brokerages as you discussed lack the liquidity to even tackle this; would Uncle Sam even be able to meaningfully intervene to see sellers given their due or would this result in something even more dangerous than what we saw in 2008?  2 Is it possible for Citadel/Melvin and any other involved shorts to file bankruptcy prior to this squeeze to effectively prevent a payout? I am not versed in bankruptcy laws on this scope   3 Provided there IS a way to ensure sellers can receive their gains even if eventually and that the can cannot be kicked *off* the road what do you truly believe the upper limit of this to be? I personally think shit will begin to break around 50k/share given at that point things will be irreparably damaged for the market makers  Thoughts?  Well done on the post; take my like you ape!,2021-03-18 02:15:11.924422

And the crime of it is that it's the little guys that are going to get eaten by it  Dude with 100 shares is going to dip the fuck out when he sees his account clear $40k on his $5k investment  It's the guys scrapping every dime and dumping their stimulus into 5 shares that will hold well past due and have nothing but bags  The whales don't think it's gonna hit 1k  They are gonna dip out too and a bunch are already gone  They don't post when they paper hand out with their free Maserati  Nobody posts when they paper hand it  So what you have left are the little guys on the roller coaster ride to the bottom  I don't want to see it happen but we all know it will  Most of these guys are holding their first shares and have no fucking clue how any of this works  They see the threads and the memes and they just think hey everybody is doing it how can I lose?,2021-03-18 02:16:50.654337

Covid as awful as it's been for millions of people had a silver lining that I was able to maintain my good paying job working from home for the past year drive very little and the fam and I started saving like a boss to really attack debt     When covid hit and layoffs started happening big time   I realized following the Dave Ramsey method and having $1k emergency wasn't going to cut it   so we dug deep and luckily with a few bonuses and saving over months built up a nice little 2-3 month emergency fund  Then went back to tackling debt    2 weeks ago we became debt free besides the mortgage   We got $5600 in stimulus this time around   I ended up giving both my kids $300 because its been a rough year for them as well and they deserved it   As much as I want GME to succeed I'm sitting out using the stimulus for it and using it for some other family goals ,2021-03-18 02:17:33.858928

I only own a couple because gme is black hole and no it’s not good when billions get consumed by a black hole because it only makes the hole bigger  When bubble collapse they take out their surroundings this is an inescapable bubble  Either the gov steps in and saves the market they already have and will continue while also not spreading massive panic that this could easily collapse the entire market or it will collapse as firms buckle while gme rises infinitely for an infinite duration  My guesstimate is gme will be forced to make new shares and govt will force that to happen because right now there simply aren’t enough  thereby creating our black hole,2021-03-18 02:18:44.797048
The fuckers already did it in January  It cost me $18k when I sold my 90 shares [$275 avg] for $95 a share because I knew the game was fucking rigged  When it shot back up I couldn't fucking believe it  I jumped back in for 52 shares at $170  At first I just wanted my $18k back  But fuck them now I want $180000 00   I'm not selling this time no matter what they try and pull💎💎💎💎💎🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,2021-03-18 02:18:49.846207

"Options often have very wide spreads   That's why Citadel pays so much for the flow   They can fill anywhere inside the posted spread and still meet their ""best execution"" requirement   Congress or the SEC does need to do something about this but it's not clear how to address it   The problem is that as more orders are filled off-exchange the spreads on the exchanges get wider and the ""best execution"" requirement gets more meaningless which means that MMs can fill at worse prices which means that they can pay more for order flow which moves more traffic off exchanges which makes the spreads wider etc etc   It's a downward sprial     They need to redefine ""best execution"" in a way that takes more than exchanges into account   I have no idea how though ",2021-03-18 02:20:39.064950

Yup those same thoughts has lead me to have discussions with my parents about their IRA’s  If the market suffers even a moderate correction from the GME squeeze the psychology of panic kicks in around the market and it would drive it all further down affecting retirement accounts that have no correlation with GME and other major securities  I’m worried my parents could get hit pretty hard from this    Do I have a solution? Not really  Feels too alarmist to tell my parents to cash out their IRA’s even tho they are past the age for tax penalties  So I just told them to shift some mutual fund positions in their portfolios  There is a part of me that really wants to be wrong about this,2021-03-18 02:20:53.325160

"Hello GME holder here  I'm terribly sorry for the conduct of some people who also happen to like the stock  All memes aside there's plenty of opportunities to make money in the market other than GME  Personally I'm of the mindset that GME might possibly not necessarily plausibly reach 100k or something crazy however it might not and that's fine   Please have patience with the GME crowd many of us are learning about the specifics of the market for the first time  From what I can tell the reason why some lash out is that not only groupthink but also the sheer magnitude of how much they feel they're being screwed over the Jan halting of trade the Robinhood stuff that came out today and all manner of twists on the truth    I know this sounds cliche but some people genuinely see GME as a way of making it to a better life  This gets people emotional and well frankly prone to lashing out  I'm terribly sorry for the mudslinging going on towards genuine DD frankly people should just not read them if they don't care for them or can't approach them civilly   Honestly as much as I'm in on the GME hype train sometimes I try to ground myself by reading ""controversial"" to make sure I'm not entirely disjointed from reality  That being said I am a retail worker in college and the idea of financial independence fills me with hope  I could retire early I could donate to a good cause I could pay off the mortgage my parents have on their house so they could actually have money in the bank at the end of the month etc    I wish everyone else the best with your investing decisions and hope things remain civil  Happy investing everyone and I hope you make tons of cash in whatever you're invested in!  &#x200B;  sorry for the word wall I expect the automod to strike me down I get the filibuster one lol",2021-03-18 02:21:12.255727

I’m at the highest level but that doesn’t mean things I do don’t require collateral  Like I can sell naked calls but they reduce my buying power by a ton  Like I said a deep OTM call on SPY needs 8k in collateral in cash  They deduct 8k from my account and release it after the option expires  And that’s a very safe one if you go volatile like gme the collateral for a naked call at a strike of 250 expiring this Friday is 60k dollars      All that’s to say they hold enough collateral so there’s a safe cushion and they don’t lose money  They also liquidate if you get close to your collateral not being enough a margin call basically  How’s harm subjective? It’s only subject with people when their feelings are involved not corporations  Your broker is not gonna have its heart broken that you lied   Lying does violate good faith expectations but who cares? Everyone lies on these applications  If it was a consequential and important thing they’d confirm your answers  The fact that they don’t tells you what you need to do  Businesses always do due diligence when it comes to these thing if it matters    Also these questions and answers are required by regulation not something brokers came up with  It’s a yet another stupid bureaucratic roadblock government added to protect exceptionally stupid people  Most brokers would probably unlock everything for you without asking questions if it wasn’t for the regulations ,2021-03-18 02:22:41.251441

There is no proof for any of this  Not a single actual source was cited  GME dropped to $40 and stayed at $40 for almost a month  This is when the original shorts would have covered  Any new shorts are not at the rock bottom prices of $4 and are much easier to cover  And we know float is way below what it was last year we just had a release not too long ago  Some of you have to ask yourselves if this a campaign to get apes to hold heavy GME bags ,2021-03-18 02:25:06.065581

"I'm not a moneymonkey but take some DD on the technical aspects on AMDs products  Some of this is ""AMD good"" and some of it is ""Intel bad""    Obligatory: This is not financial advice  Feel free to take it as technical advice though  I'll send a bill   First some 30 second elevator-pitch-oneliners:  - Nvidia's top-of-the-line DGX-compute servers use AMD - Intel got burnt *badly* by spectre and meltdown the effects are still there - AMD is packing some seriously innovative features for securing virtualization  If I were buying for AWS Azure or GCE now Intel probably wouldn't be on the radar unless I got some substantial bribes    But the main point of why AMD will whip Intel for the foreseeable future is *chiplets*   AMD can make *smaller chips* have *higher yields* and avoid the multisocket-solutions Intel is stuck with  AMD can supply ridiculous amounts of cores connected to each other and sharing the same io-lanes cheap 14nm controller and cache  Of particular interest *AMD can keep the latency consistently decent between the cores* - they are physically very close to each other  Meanwhile over at Intel you still need a dual-socket system to compete with AMDs core-count and IO  But those sockets communicate over a slow QPI-bus and are physically separated so while the best case latency between two cores is excellent on same die the worst case is a long trip over a stupid wire on the motherboard that is at least 5cm of copper  Also a bitch to program efficiently    As an additional point of failure for Intel they are still on 14nm  They are getting really fucking good at that 14nm-node but at this point the only thing they can do is to increase TDP  Look at their latest lineup *decreasing* core-count to allow for frequency-boosts within a reasonable  TDP  Gamers won't care that much about performance/watt but for data centers and laptops it's huge  For example high-performance computing centers will burn more money on electricity and cooling than the hardware so performance/watt is the only relevant metric for some large costumers    Further down the line DDR5-memory is coming bringing obligatory ECC to the table  Support for ECC-memory is a major deal for servers and most workstations  AMD has had ECC enabled on *all* new desktop and server CPUs from the cheapest Ryzen and up  On Intels side ECC is at this point the only relevant differentiator between their consumer i3/5/7/9-series and their workstation Xeons  *That differentiator will disappear* and suddenly Intels lineup is just really fucking weird  Intels entire workstation-lineup will be gone  Their other major differentiator is multi-socket support which we already bashed  So Intels lineup will probably be a fucking mess for a few years    On a technical level the thing I think could sink AMD is if Intel starts poppin out server-chips with high core-counts >=64 *on a smaller node* in the near future  But that won't happen  Intels smaller nodes are not mature enough for chips of that size to have high enough yield  But even if Intel got their shit under control with regards to their fabs *AMD will always have higher yields due to their chiplet design*     The major non-technical risk I see with AMD is TSMC  They need to be able to keep up with the demand from large OEMs Dell HPE    otherwise OEMs will be forced to go with Intels shitty product regardless  AMD has a license to print money but the printer is just so fucking slow  Intel on the other hand has no supply issues they have their own shittier fab   Speaking of fabs: Many people are mentioning AMDs new GPUs and comparing them to Nvidia  At this point I don't think the product matters the only relevant thing is what company can get their chips manufactured  Every single chip they make will be bought at whatever price they want  Basically another license to print money regardless of how AMD compares to Nvidia    Now the future:  Can AMD print enough money to gain a persistent technical lead and market share from Intel before Intel stops hugging their 14nm-fabs? Probably    Could they surpass Nvidia on the GPU-front? Probably not  They could be a worthy competitor but Nvidia has the upper hand  In particular Nvidia bought Mellanox which should give them huge benefits when it comes to compute-GPU which relies on high-speed interconnects  But every compute-node from Nvidia produced in the foreseeable future will probably have an expensive AMD-CPU     Short term the question is simple - Can they print enough money?",2021-03-18 02:25:37.767653

Someone please explain this to me in terms an 🦧 can understand     RH and other 0 commision investors make money on the spread from the ask to the bid right?  Do they actively delay your ask until it makes sense to them?  They still have to pay themselves a broker on the floor and a clearinghouse right?  And what difference does it make going with other apps?  Don't they all essentially do the same thing to make 0 commision trades?  I trade with Fidelity and it never says anything on the commission line my trades always go through essentially immediately and there is usually a miniscule difference from what i thought i was buying for and what i actially buy for but i thought that was just in the time delay from when i last refreshed on an active market   ,2021-03-18 02:27:16.863235

Lidar is doomed vision will win  I consider winning as achieving an order of magnitude less probability of an accident compared to human drivers   **1st argument Why vision is sufficient:**   P1  Humans can drive make vehicle control decisions using only visual input from a single field of view   P2  Vision based systems can consume 360 degree fields of view and process the information faster than a human can with a single field of view    C: Vision based systems can drive significantly safer than humans  **2nd argument why lidar is insufficient:**  P1  A self driving system must be able to drive in rain snow and fog  P2  LIDAR does not function rain snow and fog  C  LIDAR is insufficient to create a self driving system   &#x200B;  Other points not as formally constructed:  * Lidar is expensive vision systems are not * Lidar cannot penetrate solid objects and 'see through' obstacles ahead  Radar can and is used to augment vision systems  Radar is not expensive * The long as fuck tail of edge cases makes solving self driving a data-aggregation and model architecture problem  Tesla is collecting the most amount of real world driving data with a schema purpose built to train its autopilot engine  They have created a process to solve the biggest hurdle in self driving * Simulated driving data only gets you so far because of the above point  Further its a chicken/egg problem  If you could realistically simulate real world driving you would by definition have a realistic self driving system * Since vision is sufficient and cheap and lidar is expensive and insufficient lidar is not economically useful aka doomed in self driving * Things like hitting curbs bugs in Tesla FSD weird edge cases are an ML problem can can be solved with retraining and improving model architecture  These are not problems where vision fundamentally fails    Don't get me wrong I think Waymo and the other self driving companies are cool AF and the people working there are a lot smarter than I am but I think eventually they will all build vision first systems and abandon Lidar    My predictions to first production FSD:  1  Tesla 2  Comma 3  Whoever does the third working vision system,2021-03-18 02:28:59.675088

"Alright you're giving me a headache let's take a look at margin calls on synthetic or naked shorts a short can go synthetic or naked based if Bob asked Jerry if he has a stock to borrow Jerry says yes Bob doesn't borrow right away John borrows it but because Bob located a stock he was allowed to short it and sell it  Depending on the amount and the brokerage a margin account has to have 25-30% of the loan  ""Margin trading is regulated by the federal government and other self-regulatory agencies in an effort to mitigate potentially crippling losses for both investors and brokerages""  This is one of the things I call a fraud stop and yes I DID come up with the term its just easier for my brain ok?  But we're naked shorting meaning we really don't have that stock right? Right so we're actually in debt 70-75% of the shorted stock but we sold the stock and made that 100% back right? Uh-oh the stock went up so I actually have to buy back that stock that I never had and because of that I'm actually sub-100% and because I only need 25% to be margin called I can technically let the stock go up 400% and still have enough to cover my calls  Now im margin called and I can't cover the 25% so they make me sell      but I cant    so I fail to deliver  Well now if I'm understanding this right I owe the brokerage a large sum of money theres a share out there that I never had so I have to buy that share and now me and the brokerage is up shit creek without a paddle because the money and share don't exist  I also tried finding the original article as to why naked shorting is illegal I read it a while ago and it covered reported several people between 2012 and 2015 who were fined 90k-250k and had an average jail time of 7 to 15 years because they lied or helped people about their income and availability to cover these losses unfortunately I can't find it and most articles I've found are linked to IRS income fraud or just say the same old shit that ""you report your income and how much experience and if you're conservative or aggressive to your brokerage so if things go to court they can wash their hands of this"" which again is another thing I call fraud stop  If I'm wrong about this I'm wrong but honestly I don't care at this point good luck to ya and hope you make your money and live a happy life im gonna play it safe and just report correctly",2021-03-18 02:29:07.274819

Excellent points here  I think what you could and should also consider are the quasi-shorts those that have sold naked calls  Let's say you sold a ton of naked calls at 250 and you want to keep selling them because  fuck have you seen what they sell for??? You want to keep the price below 270ish so no one exercises the itm but not profitable call but ideally just below 250 so you can keep selling otm calls but you also want to keep the proce high enough to create hope  210 to 220 sounds perfect for me  Now you could do this at any price but it looks like the market the float the buying interest short attacks  fear etc has settled on the low 200s as sustainable ,2021-03-18 02:29:17.341212

Duuuude he’s saying there are bag holders that have a vested interest in pumping ridiculous price targets to newbs so the bags can be passed when it does moon  He’s not saying $400 is the top just that 100k/500k is not realistic    at 100k gme would have a market cap of 6 trillion or 12% of the ENTIRE stock market  It can’t reach that because no one can realistically pay it out not even the government  Full disclosure I’ve got 100k in gme so I’m not exactly opposed to 100k lol just gotta be realistic ,2021-03-18 02:29:27.200963

You can do it you just can't claim the losses on your taxes  When you do it on a single broker it's still pretty easy to do your taxes as the brokerage can account for it in your tax documents   If you do it across multiple brokerages one hand cannot see what the other is doing so it's up to you to figure it all out and makes your filing more complicated ,2021-03-18 02:29:37.512318

Hm  That might be the exit strategy that both a wouldn’t piss off anybody **too** much and b would prevent our entire financial system from collapsing    Say the price of GME gets to $10000 - the point at which Citadel and Melvin would have to liquidate everything they have in order to buy back their stocks that they sold short and transitively point just before which brokerages such as Fidelity etc would have to start using their own funds to cover what Citadel and Melvin can’t - Fidelity could just shut off trading completely and give every single investor the option to sell however many shares they want at exactly $10000  This way everyone gets to cash out or they can take the gamble and hold on to some or all of their shares to see how far this thing goes    - All the shorts get covered   - The financial system stays intact   - All the GME hodlers get rich   - Citadel and Melvin go bankrupt for their poor decisions  - Everyone’s happy    Seems like the best option to me  But don’t listen to me  I’m just an ape ,2021-03-18 02:30:23.164647

To start with the funds who short sold the stock   After that it would be the brokerage RH Fidelity et  al  then the DTCC   A few hedge funds could go down easily   No one gives a shit about them anyway   Some smaller brokerages could fall too   I doubt it would get any further than that   The numbers people are throwing around aren't realistic even in a short squeeze   There might be a few holding some token shares to see where it goes but everyone else will be selling like crazy if it breaks a few thousand   If it actually go to $5000 and the full float sold and it can't because some of it is tied up by insiders and institutions that can't actively trade them that's $300 billion   Papa Musk could almost write a check for that   It's not going to bring down the economy at that level ,2021-03-18 02:31:13.365750

Everyone keep mentioning transfers maybe that’s what they want  The more the mention the more money they will save on shorting   If they see a shit ton of people transferring they might see some money lost in the ether and let up a bit on the shorts so    I mean totally guys I’m transferring like a motherfucker ,2021-03-18 02:32:54.157017

Yeah the problem that I feel like we are seeing now is that every broker is fucking us right now but in different ways I suppose  Honestly in your situation I think Robinhood is just a shit broker with delayed pricing  Free ends up getting expensive   This whole gamestop fiasco has shown that they are all willing to manipulate us for their benefit  Im looking to leave TD will probably migrate over either to fidelity of IB,2021-03-18 02:33:17.248469

Oh nooooo someone on the internets called me a bad name what will I do now? I get it people who do dumb things like to sit in their echo chamber and be jerked off by other people doing the same dumb things  That’s why you can find 20+ meaningless GME posts for every post about any other stock or with any real substance at all  I just feel bad for these poor people seeing all these posts and think that somehow it’s proof that it’s even a halfway good idea to throw their savings at this stock because they’ve been “assured” that it will rocket  We saw it last time and we will see it again  But at least the first time you could understand how it happened  This time it’s just sad  There’s no “hold the line” there’s just the people making money off the spikes and the people left holding bags  This isn’t going to have any lasting effect if anything the HFs will figure out how to make sure it never happens again ,2021-03-18 02:33:29.268338

I've accidentally sold stocks while I was trying to transfer out of RH once on impulse and once because of a stop loss  Finally got my positions over to Fidelity yet all that will happen is that you won't be able to complete the transfer because the stocks you specified aren't in your account at the time  At least that was my experience so take it with a grain of salt  Maybe try calling up Fidelity and talking to one of their advisors about it they're pretty chill ,2021-03-18 02:33:43.533932

"> Is life not building upon itself?  Not really no   Sentience+sapience is the cutoff beyond which evolution is fundamentally untenable   Things which evolve follow a relatively linear evolution for whichever time scale they experience generationally   Additionally they experience environmental constraints from which they derive their imperatives/drives   However harsh and unforgiving an environment is be it natural or societal is however extreme their imperatives and drives need to be for their existence   There might be some ambiguity here in terms of species which evolved in harsh environments vs relative paradises but generally an organism will always maximize population for a given set of resources so it can be assumed that the overwhelming majority or species evolve in ""harsh"" environments even if only because some environmental stressors and constraints are required to facilitate evolution   This ""harshness"" of environment can be seen from an experiential perspective as about on par as what we see as surviving in the world to be somewhat tautologically because of the fact it's what we see and what we've evolved for   But again this whole process is linear from an evolutionary perspective   Barring extreme events culling substantial portions of _very_ diverse populations there are no exponential changes and the few there are are short-lived as populations take time to recover from such events   Technology as a whole is evidence of this: it's literally the solution not a good one to The Fermi Paradox   Organisms evolve over relatively linear scales technology on the other hand compounds upon itself with each advancement building upon or leading to more advancements   In turn once a species evolves to the point wherein they see technology as a viable tool or solution to literally any problem they begin augmenting their environment or their experiential perspective of it at an exponential rate as each organism is hard-wired to optimize for those innate imperatives/drives whatever they may be which were conferred from a linear evolutionary process and were wired in contrast to their environment to equalize/balance their existence within it   What this means in short is that once a species develops technology they're already effectively extinct if they continue to adhere to evolutionary standards; and if they don't well good luck with that because there's no basis for knowing a better solution at that point   ^^^This ^^^is ^^^not ^^^financial ^^^advice ^^^and ^^^I ^^^am ^^^not ^^^a ^^^professional ^^^everyone ^^^here ^^^is ^^^an ^^^actual ^^^retard ",2021-03-18 02:35:39.755322

"Title says ""Why the MOASS is real"" but then you don't say why it's real     Yet this has 14k upvotes based on pure hope?  As someone questioned me when I claimed that what we are really seeing is a SQUEEZE TRAP I will forward the question to you: What evidence do you have?  The volume is dead  These contract expiration dates you are talking about DO NOT EXIST for short positions  Only for options   So wtf are you talking about? How is this a DD with crazy upvotes?? Short positions can be held indefinitely as long as they pay the interest and maintain margin requirements set by the brokers / clearing houses that broker and clear their trades   Please dont read this post  Yes MOASS as a concept is a real thing but to think there is one that is imminent anymore for GameStop is an absolute FANTASY  The short interest is less than 50% of GMEs float  It is not 140% anymore   On top of this based on the volume and obvious dips it's clear that HFs are running this GME ship selling tons of OTM options to retail dreamers and playing both sides by buying up shares as well as selling shares short at highly established positions   Sure diamond hand some expendible GME shares but don't fuck around with money you can't afford to lose please folks    Not financial advice make your own decisions  I can't stand to read these same MOASS posts for another month as they continue to string people along",2021-03-18 02:35:57.864344

Float is number of shares available to trade  Like sitting in people's or funds brokerage accounts  Sometimes they are leant out to short sellers or MM's wanting to hedge  Shares that are not considered in the float cannot be traded easily  Think of non-float shares as stock certificates sitting in a bank vault  This generally doesn't change on a day to day basis much if at all   Volume describes the number of shares traded in a given time period  If I say today's volume was 10M that means 10M shares traded hands during the day ,2021-03-18 02:36:34.808679

See these high price targets always fail to mention how difficult it will be to maintain momentum with higher price targets retail will be priced out and large institutions dont want to take on as much risk  Like 1000 a share will price out so many retail traders  And make it so much more difficult to maintain volume  And shorting then becomes much more lucrative and easier as the downside opens up so much more   I just feel like so many people are missing the practical aspects of achieving this crazy high price targets like 10000 a share  I think 1000 is very realistic but once you start going past that? Option liquidity will dry up stock liquidity will dry up and shorting will become easier  A bunch of people will also paper hand once it gets into the 1000s which alleviates buying pressure more   I just want someone to explain how these types of projections manifest rather than purely speculating using mathematical analysis  It just creates more confirmation bias and blind hope rather than an empirical backing ,2021-03-18 02:37:11.416739

Shorting costs money which they may not have much of at this point there aren't a huge amount of shares to borrow against and the low volume recently means liquidity is drying up  So any price movements downwards like happened last week will be met with equal or more than likely greater force upwards as it becomes cheaper to buy shares  A short attack is possible but it might be a huge final mistake as it acts as a slingshot    especially if it's true that there are long whales in the water who have just as much or more money to throw at this than short funds do ,2021-03-18 02:37:27.688327

Very bullish today and the baseline is $10 so it's still a smart buy  The news about them making their brokers pick them or Rocket and their report about not hitting their mark for how many signed the deal didn't slow it down at all and honestly it must have helped  The movement today brought a lot of calls ITM and if it pops to 10 or jesus 11 by friday that is a lot of calls that need covered  Then they are listing on the Russel index on friday  These factors highly indicate strong buying pressure all through next week  And like I said they are below their baseline  700 @ 8 65,2021-03-18 02:38:14.988297

I agree with this  Totally up to each and everyone of us  But it’s become obvious even just being in this group for a handful of months that the demographic has changed  It went from a bunch of people who understood this very well to a bunch of people who don’t get it at all  They come here asking for someone to give them sound financial reasoning on GME  If you’re asking that question in this group on a stock like GME then you’re taking risks you have no concept of  And I wouldn’t care at all except that it’s people throwing away their savings and assistance checks that they most likely need in hopes of getting rich  But it takes sheer dumb luck to get rich day trading if you’re at the level where you need to make these kinds of posts ,2021-03-18 02:39:19.260607

That is why I think it’s only a small possibility that brokers freeze selling  It would cause a legal shitstorm and class action lawsuits  Plus what you have said about investor’s trust is absolutely true it’s paramount to maintain that trust in the markets otherwise the whole thing gets screwed   I believe GME holders will see a nice payday but final selling price will likely be determined by brokers or government intervention,2021-03-18 02:39:53.366122

Questrade is delayed by 15 too on the main holdings/account page    but when you go to sell/buy the stock its got a refresh button that is realtime and then counts seconds up since your last refresh      My technique i guess is to do a sell order for what i would be happy to get and then if it doesnt clear as fast as i want i modify it to the ask price   A couple cents a share isnt worth sweating over when its 1800    But ya market sell just opena you up to citadel using your shares to cover their losses ,2021-03-18 02:39:56.771044

He is selling calls right? That is a neutral to bullish move  Depending of it's naked or not really  So he thinks the stock might go up or stay the same but not go above a certain amount   by a certain time   Very different than literally short selling the stock which directly causes stocks to go down and is directly betting against the stock from going up   The title really is disinformation ,2021-03-18 02:40:36.122551

Mm no no    This is in NO way on the people buying GME  This is because of the HFs and their unchecked tactics that spun out of control  This is not on us whatsoever    You say manipulation is fucked but its okay because it creates a volatile market? You make 500% a day? Dang    There will still be plenty of opportunity to swing trade  Essentially every single private security out there is acting as it should and your career choice will be just fine  There will be some red days so pull out and sit on your cash    You're welcome for the opportunity to know what is about to happen and then the opportunity to also be able to buy back into things low once the dust has settled and make those great gains again ,2021-03-18 02:41:02.380378

This resonates well  Keeping the price sideways while buying up as many calls between $220 and $280 is going to be the all around cheapest way to create a gamma squeeze for this week  Next week it might be different prices  But keeping the price stable for another day marginally lowers iv which lowers the cost of the options which then creates a more desirable buy price Friday morning to prime a solid gamma squeeze ,2021-03-18 02:41:30.908277

Dude take a deep breath  Again  Deep breath  Chances are that the squeeze happens tomorrow are extremely extremely slim  You'll be just fine really  For hedgies it's a fight for survival  They will give everything they have  All this saga may last way longer than we think  I personally believe that you did the right thing transfering as long as it is not selling no financial advice of course you individual and independant ape   Let me double up on reassurance  There's a fucking strong community of individual apes around this stock  If EVER the squeeze were to happen tomorrow wich would be absolutely unexpected I am absolutely sure that the apes left behind in the transfer would see many tendies from luckier apes who didn't use RH  After all they took a risk that benefits ultimately all the apes transfer force buying from RH part  Also the squeeze will last for days   Again deep breath  You'll be just fine ,2021-03-18 02:42:34.526759

First of all  >	This is one of the things I call a fraud stop and yes I DID come up with the term its just easier for my brain ok?  Imagine if a doctor discussing a brain hemorrhage with another doctor and called it a “brain ouchie” just because it was easier on their brain    dude you don’t just make up words when discussing something so specific    Regarding your naked shorting scenario: dude what the fuck are you talking about? You been reading too much GME conspiracy fantasy? Naked shorting is illegal  You can’t naked short as a retail investor you don’t find a stock to short  You don’t talk to anyone  You don’t “borrow” you just put a short sell order if your broker says it’s available  That’s it  If it fills you’re not short  They’ll hold a ton of money on top of that as collateral and they will liquidate your short aka buy back the share if you get close to your collateral not being enough  I just checked if I short sell a single Tesla stock at $700 they reduce my buying power for $350 and they’ll close my short if Tesla hits $900  That’s how it works that’s how they don’t lose money   The stories you read is probably about actual professionals with access to much lower levels tools than you get from brokerages kinda like how hedge funds do  You can’t do these things you’re talking about on a brokerage open to public no matter how high your level is,2021-03-18 02:43:31.645318

DO NOT SELL YOUR SHARES TO TRANSFER OUT OF ROBINHOOD!!!  If you have to leave open a new account first  Link your bank account and deposit money  After the transfer is complete and you still think holding the shares you own on RH is unsafe review the new trading apps rules on account transfers   Personally I opened a TD Ameritrade account at the end of January  All my new funds go in there  I have 200 shares of GME and some cash to buy yummy dips  I am going to hold my shares of GME in Robinhood in case this rockets anytime soon  You will get your money!   Please don't listen to all the FUD  Do your own DD and think about your plan  If you set up an account transfer more likely than not it will take over a week to finalize longer if done midweek    Just keep holding your RH shares of GME open a new trading account transfer any extra money into it  DO NOT SELL YOUR SHARES   tdlr: bots and shills tryna get us to sell  Do not sell your shares  Hodl and open a new account ,2021-03-18 02:43:56.846221

"""Never lived through a period of Elevated inflation""?!  Dude The minimum wage hasn't been raised since 2009 and inflation increases on average 1 9% to 2 3% per year far out pacing increases in wages to essentially make it so that most of the 18 - 25 year olds don't have a chance of building wealth    Why attack a bunch of young people trying to find their financial strength when the system is stacked against them  What the fuck is this guy talking about?   These kids who ""don't want to talk about bonds or interest rates"" don't have to file taxes on income this year until next year anyway and this situation right now will be the greatest opportunity they will ever have to reshape the system  This isn't about just making tendies this is about reshaping a lopsided coercive financial system into something more fair and equitable    For us old timers who can see how much this exposes the unfair advantages that financial giants have had that we've seen for years and have been unable to do nothing about these kids found a way and it's not illegal to share information and make your own decisions based on good research   This guy needs to be cancelled ",2021-03-18 02:44:06.133163

Hi Alexis  Could you reiterate your thoughts on 'Gamification'? I felt they were a bit 'nanny' state-ish   From a personal evaluation of the situation the stock market is absolutely speculation - and that's the way it should remain  I understand the need for some regulation but what we actually need is more transparency and information - information in this day and age is the great leveler  Another leveler is constructing algorithms - but that's IP ,2021-03-18 02:44:08.986307

The more shares in the float/market the harder it is to move the price of the underlying  Supply and Demand like with anything else  PLTR has 1 47 billion outstanding shares  Only 13% are held by insiders  So 1 23 billion are in the public float  Which is a lot for any company  Would take a shit ton of buying and selling to move the price very much ,2021-03-18 02:44:11.790821

 RKT is only 40% above its all time low  NBD    PLTR is only 1 7x from its all time low which was at IPO time  They weren’t shorting back then  This won’t hurt them too much either    AMC is 7x from all time low  Yeah that’s gonna hurt a bit but they’ll survive    GME is over 50x from its all time low  This is the one that’s going to kill them   That’s why you see so much more fuckery in the GME chart while AMC just rides  GME is the one they need to suppress to stay alive ,2021-03-18 02:44:20.229157

DD in the past week or two suggests the idea that the new SI numbers are fudged and true SI estimated to range anywhere from 1 3x float to an extreme of 9x float  140 was the value before hedgies had any excuse to bs their numbers so its a good starting point  Since it was the SI during the Jan squeeze attempt it also gives us a point of comparison to what could happen soon ,2021-03-18 02:45:12.323158

Sorry for the long ass rant  I'm using this to walk myself through my thoughts   1  I hate myself for being a party pooper  But I spend 90% of my time going through the memes I gotta get my head back to reality    2  I've spent a lot of time now trying to find a source for the $60trillion insurance  Nobody can produce a source  Forgive me but I don't believe it at this point   3  Let's just pretend that it does come to that   a $60trillion payout  First that's more than the market cap of NYSE and NASDAQ combined  Nobody in the world has $60trillion for a policy payout  Liquid assets illiquid assets doesn't matter doesn't exist   4  Let's pretend somebody *does* have $60trillion to pay out  First problem inflation would probably come into play but that's not worth spending mental energy  Second problem is  If they do have that money it'd probably in illiquid assets  They'd have to sell $60trillion worth of assets to buy our GME shares  Who would possibly buy $60T worth of stuff? With $60T of assets the value and price of said assets would plummet nobody exists to buy   5  Let's pretend somebody *does* have $60T in assets and *did* sell them for $60T  They now give us that money  Their GME shares are now almost worthless maybe worth $200-$400 optimistically  GME holders have $60T in cash? More money than currently exists? There's inflation possibly again                   I can't even think what might happen next  Stock market would be worthless? We buy the shares of the general market? Who do we buy them from? Who owns them? This whole thing is truly an economic or financial singularity  My logic definitely goes wrong somewhere in this thought experiment    6  The real takeaway here is that it's not going to happen  Nobody is going to be paying out $60T  It's fun and entertaining to fantasize  But it is child-like naivety irrationally delusional cult-like to think anything like this will happen  It physically can't happen  And if it could government banks fucking NATO lol wouldn't let it happen   I do hope to hell we get the squeeze  It's fun to meme and fantasize but I don't like seeing stupid and oft-repeated false information spread  We gotta keep our wits ,2021-03-18 02:45:22.931664

What's interesting is if what they're saying about GME tanking the rest of the stock market if it squeezes is accurate then there really isn't any other stock because you'll lose money on everything else  It's kinda of hard to take any other DD seriously for anything else if GME is this star that could die at any second and make a black hole and potentially cause a massive stock market correction ,2021-03-18 02:46:38.767855

Sell all your GME before it’s worthless and put your profits into Palantir  It’s a real company with actual long term upside  GME was a short squeeze that made anyone who got in early a ton of money if they sell before it crashes  It will crash  I feel terrible seeing people taking mortgages on their homes and buying GME at these current inflated rates  Take whatever you can and get out of GME while it’s still inflated from the recent madness  You don’t see bearish posts about GME because it’s honestly a joke and for people who can’t see the joke it’s on them ,2021-03-18 02:48:45.624259

Strongly disagree  YouTube is filled with videos of Tesla’s “failures” because A  there are only 600 waymos representing 6 million miles versus 1000000 Teslas representing *5 4 billion* miles *per year*  Tesla drives more miles each day than Waymo has driven EVER  That creates orders of magnitude more interactions including autopilot failures to fuel those compilations you watched  b  As others have mentioned Waymo works super well in a very limited scope  Put it in the same situations as Tesla and it’s autonomy disappears    Speaking of which Tesla’s computer vision and neural network will render LIDAR unnecessary  LIDAR is like training wheels on a bicycle: it makes you look like you are a great driver and terrible without it  But as with bicycling eventually you outgrow the need for it and you discover you can accomplish more without it   Finally Waymo reports a crash every ~333000 miles drive   Tesla autopilot reports a crash every 1 4 million miles driven    🏆 Tesla,2021-03-18 02:49:32.588847

QUESTION: I have been using RH for a while but don't want to go through the trouble of switching brokers atm but when GME squeezes will RH be able to block any kind of selling when it's above a certain price?? I wouldn't think so because it would just help them since me selling technically decreases demand /price of the stock so I shouldn't have to worry right? Sorry if this is a dumb question but I have 0 zero wrinkles on my brain ,2021-03-18 02:50:25.353995

"Thank you so much for your testimony  I have been arguing this to coworkers that were critical of retail traders and their ""irrational behavior "" 🙄 Retail traders did not create the GME volatility  The problem started with whales taking illegal short positions & other whales going long to profit  Retail investors may be the loud rambunctious soldiers on the frontline of the longs but they are backed by serious money that is all too happy to let them take ""credit"" i e  blame for everything going wrong in the stock market ",2021-03-18 02:51:58.753528

You’d be at risk of assignment if you bought 100 shares and sold an ITM call yes  But you likely wouldn’t be assigned right away   Here’s how it works: there are two styles of options European and American that has nothing to do with where you buy them or where the company is  The main difference that you need to worry about is that European options can’t be exercised early but American ones can  DAL is an American style option unless I’m mistaken    So let’s say you do your plan: you buy 100 DAL and sell a $50 call  Whoever bought your call could if they wanted call their broker and exercise it  Their broker lets the clearinghouse know and the clearinghouse randomly picks someone to get exercised  Then that person’s broker deposit is the money to pay for the contract into the seller’s account and grabs the shares sends them back to the clearinghouse who gives it to the buyer’s broker who delivers to the buyer    For the most part the risk of getting early assigned is low  No one in their right mind would buy a $50 contract for $4 90 and then turn around and exercise it  One exception might be if there is an ex dividend date coming up then there might be a reason someone would exercise early though it would still be dumb to exercise an option you just bought — it’d cheaper to just buy the shares   There’s not really a catch  The only way you really lose is if the stock moves a lot against you you could miss out on gains on the top  Also if the stock were going down in value you couldn’t just sell your 100 shares  You’d need to account for the shares you’re short first in other words your broker isn’t going to let you be short 100 shares of DAL — you’d either need to close the contract or buy another call to leg into a spread ,2021-03-18 02:52:16.042404

"Government ""asks"" GME to issue 50 million new shares at $200 per share in a public offering  You wonder how they get out of this?

Assuming this really occurs my guess is a freeze is put on the stock and then a few days later you will get an email from your broker asking what price you are willing to sell for     You’d be bidding blind not knowing what others are willing to take to sell   People who asked too high would be fucked when the stock reopened    I think before it gets to that point though Yellen hands out some IOUs to get major shareholders to loosen the $ROPE and sell some shares off market ,2021-03-18 02:53:24.431511

I am not a single though not married  I have my savings so I do what I want with them  If I save for something with my wife for example for a house then we have OUR savings at some place  If he says these are HIS savings then I assume that they already have  what's needed or that they have some other savings somewhere else  These savings are HIS so he can do whatever he wants that's what I think  UNLESS he lies and these are indeed THEIR savings then it's fucked up ,2021-03-18 02:54:12.023411

It is the fault of the banks and the fed in the first place   The hedge funds are paying interest on huge sums of money that the banks are very happy to collect   That’s why they were allowed to massively over-over-leverage   The banks borrow money for free because of the fed policies   They are given that privilege b/c they are supposed to carry minimal risk   This is the problem with a 0% benchmark rate when the actual risk profile can never be low enough to justify that   The banks have to find synthetic mechanisms for making these bets and they have to make money on very slim margins   But they have essentially unbounded volume   So they think ok roughly infinity*0 0001=infinity   Where can you hide it?  In the tail of GME an over-simplified example being the selling of 800c contracts when you have the power to make sure they will never be exercised   The hedge funds are the guys the banks pay to get their hands dirty and take the fall   The banks guarantee that the hedgies will never see jail time or confiscation of personal assets   Have you heard Jamie Dimon speak?  Did you ever ask yourself how someone who is maybe slightly above average intelligence is worth billions?,2021-03-18 02:55:17.890667

GME probably worth $25-30 but I really don’t see AMC at a $13B market cap  Sure they may actually produce real earnings per share this year but that doesn’t get them out of the fundamental reason why they became debt leveraged in the first place    It’s incredibly expensive for them to expand at this point  Streaming services are more aggressive than they ever have been in providing brand new top tier content  On top of that there are better places to see a movie  Alamo Drafthouse is the shit catch me dead watching a movie anywhere else   This is one big dead cat bounce that could last a year  By 2024 AMC is going up to the heavens with blockbuster and RadioShack unless they completely transform their business and I don’t see how they can,2021-03-18 02:56:05.346907

I think it should be obvious that the media driven David v  Goliath has been overblown  The main factor in the first squeeze and the one we are in currently is driven by other hedgefunds  Sure WSB may have had a small hand in it but even with the 9m members here we don’t have the capital or capability to cause the volume spikes that occurred    Great questions Alexis!,2021-03-18 02:56:09.043005

I think the negative beta is better explained by the shorting of GME via ETFs   As GME was shorted via ETFs HFs bought underlying securities to remain neutral  Hence GME down market up    If/when the ETF shorts were covered GME up market down   As the risk of ETFs rebalancing and recalling shares increases ETFs are no longer being used to short GME and it returns to positive beta ,2021-03-18 02:56:10.155022

No I'm basing it on the fact that gme is still over $200  Why would it still be that high if there wasn't still significant short interest? You're telling me retail is holding it up that high? No another hf is keeping it that high just for shits and giggles? The positive news alone is keeping it that high? I doubt all of those  The current value of GME has nothing to do with perception unless you're telling me my physical vision is actually that bad which could be true tbh,2021-03-18 02:58:00.577156

As I understand it a lot of that stuff goes back to things like fomo and repeatable human actions   a cup and handle may work because people see that it mooned twice original bag holders may get out when it moons the second time creating the handle  with the price dropping due to a lot of selling and then others wanna jump on because it’s a good price of course we are talking about stocks that haven’t been heavily “manipulated” or don’t have as much attention as gamestop so cup and handle may or may not work because a lot of people see the obvious pattern and thus u may have more people shorting it because they know people see the pattern  I guess u can really say it may go up or it may go down but for the love of go’s I hope it goes up cuz I really want tendies,2021-03-18 02:58:20.217822

This   Jealously guarding information is smart for big players  But to act on the same level as big players at that level we need to be able to work together to some degree  That doesn't mean market manipulation and telling other people what to buy but it *does* mean making clear what *you* think is a smart bet so that others who agree can join based on their own choices   Does this let the hedgies know what we're doing? Yes  It's also the only way we can let *each other* know what we're doing   For hedgies it's purely harmful to be open about their positions  For us it's a double edged sword and we have to decide whether it's more harmful to do so or more useful  I err on the side of useful ,2021-03-18 02:59:30.945437

Let's just hope that flying spaghetti monster doesn't come for you  The method is and has always been to try to kick the can down the road for others to deal with    but someone will be left holding the can or bag in this case   Maybe the problem is that enough people ignore these problems in the first place?   &#x200B;  Most likely things will just continue getting worse and worse    and more and more people will try to insulate themselves rather than addressing the underlying issuesas that is the MO and ignore the negatives  Everything looks amazing when you ignore the negatives unless you happen to be crushed by them and can't ignore them   Only time will tell what happens  One can always stop digging the hole and climb out    as long as the hole hasn't collapsed in on you before you had a chance   &#x200B;  The good news is simple: The US government can print up magic fairy dust until the cows come home  If they do this wisely they could do it to save themselves and maybe many others    but I have no faith in the government  They are really good at moving cans around     but what happens when the music stops?,2021-03-18 02:59:38.200495

Normally id agree but this situation is so far from normal  Conservative numbers show they'll have to buy the entire float many times over just to cover  Given that it frankly doesn't matter what retail does  Buy sell  Doesnt matter institutions could do it all on their own  Retail could likely do it all on their own too even if all institutions sold less sure about that due to reported numbers being from many different sources and inconsistent but it would be close at least from the numbers I've looked at ,2021-03-18 03:00:59.897500

Sure    and?

While there's a good amount of DD anticipating good even great things and some theoretical calculations of some insanity that has never ever come even close to happening in the history of stocks I warmly recommend taking each and every one with a grain of salt    I'm not saying it'd be wrong to expect and hope for great things     I do think it's possible for there to be some unheard of events in the near future and I too hope for it but it is a very good thing to maintain some skepticism critical thinking being realistic and NOT believing it'd be guaranteed to hit thousands upon thousands of dollars per share just because there are hundreds of DD threads around saying it will practically break the world economy      As sad as it is to admit no one actually knows for 100% sure   Not saying this to argue just to reel away a little of the kind of hype that can be damagingly blinding to an investor   Hell I gotta keep trying to do it to myself as well to not get tunnel vision  Reading what sounds like the best thing ever can be deceptive since our minds want to believe in it so hard that it can toss reason out entirely    and when money's involved it's best kept in the picture    Let's hope for the best!,2021-03-18 03:02:10.897211

I have been thinking about what would happen if when GME hits $1000 per share   I personally would be at $60000 profit and many others would be at a much higher number than that   The brokers would be responsible for paying us if we decided to withdraw our earnings right?  But what would happen if they didn't have enough liquidity?  Would they just go bankrupt?  I'm sure we couldn't actually make the hedge funds pay us since it's not really their responsibility   My main question is if all of us decide to cash out with huge profits who is going to pay us and how are they going to get the cash?

Thanks for your candor and honest testimony   The hearings seem to be overly concerned with gamification and payment for order flow   Citizens do not care about gamification  We welcome the convenience of Robinhood  I wish an honest broker would follow suit  Payment for order flow - ok maybe that creates some issues  Still it’s not THE issue  These are red hearings   We are mad about the absurd short selling cover-ups the way media and government take sides the way they paint retail as market manipulators hypocrites the way the game was stopped the title of the hearing by Robinhood   Short selling and asymmetric trade restricting should be the focus of these hearings   I didn’t hear one mention of a short squeeze until we were 1 5 hearings in  It’s like everyone is pretending they don’t know what a short squeeze is   Do you think Congress has a different agenda than the citizens or doesn’t understand?,2021-03-18 03:03:30.489532

">No I'm basing it on the fact that gme is still over $200  Why would it still be that high if there wasn't still significant short interest?     short interest doesn't dictate the price of a stock  this is actual nonsense     >You're telling me retail is holding it up that high?    probably has a lot to do with it  usually people don't refuse to let go of essentially worthless shares     >No another hf is keeping it that high just for shits and giggles? The positive news alone is keeping it that high? I doubt all of those     okay? so you think it's just because everyone actually knows the TRUTH that short interest is actually 47473929% and a squeeze is inevitable? that's your theory? do you have literally any evidence whatsoever to back this up? you can't use the high price as ""evidence"" here because then you're making a circular argument ",2021-03-18 03:03:50.765902

"This is an interesting perspective on things   I too believe that the MOASS will occur but I don't think any of ""The Powers That Be"" TPTB will allow it   There is far too much fallout in letting it get out of control   Circuit breakers will kick in the NYSE will halt trading brokerages will disable everyone's ability to buy or sell primarily buy like last time and as you mentioned someone is going to be left holding a very heavy bag   If it's Retail investors the financial media and Cramer types will say ""See!?  We told you so!"" and bash WSB and ""meme stocks"" and we'll all be left holding our dicks   If the billionaire hedge funds get left holding the bag they'll get a big fat bailout and the Retail investment crowd will probably get investigated again at least the major players like DFV and the rules will change to prevent this from every happening again   The squeeze has to happen unless they change the rules which is unlikely but I can't imagine it getting any bigger than 5x what it is now   We'll see   TL:DR - Short squeeze coming just not into the tens of thousands ",2021-03-18 03:08:02.431964

I was planning on buying a house in about 6 months so I've been watching the market for the last 4 months now   Saw a house I liked that was going to list this week on Monday   They called for best and final offers by end of day Monday and had a pending sale by EOD Tuesday   I also know houses are listing at about 20% higher than they were 4 months ago and are selling for above asking price   That's just my area but my sister is in a different state and she just listed the house her husband owned before they got married and they had 34 showings by EOD Saturday and had best and final offers on Monday   I believe they had it narrowed down to two different offers that were about 20% over asking price and they already had it marked way up ,2021-03-18 03:10:52.481292

DTCC is not the savior I trust them to act in their best interests however and try to save themselves to survive  Citadel isnt all of the DTCC either they share with other big fish that won't take too kindly to be putting at such crazy amounts of risk  Sure they could just be using these moves to further cover up what they've been doing by showing they found no wrong doing but that's just even more kicking the can down the road and at this point aint gonna help them  Also I don't think they can enact governmental change fast enough to make FTD a non starter as that would be the level of change they'd have to force to make all their problems go away  Lastly the DTCC can pay up without going bankrupt  Not citadel ofc they'd be fucked but the DTCC would be fine as long as they cut this off soon ,2021-03-18 03:11:29.002299

The orig post is talking about the 10 calls  Max pain is at 9 and the 9 calls at that time had a 33 delta meaning that at expiry they'll have a roughly 1/3 chance of being in the money  The fact that it hit 9 today means very little other than now it's more like 50/50 chance that the 9s will be in the money  The 10s are at about a 25 delta now a 1 in 4 chance roughly  The max pain idea is that option writers will work hard to make sure the 10s don't print   Based on this I wouldn't buy the 9s or the 10s ,2021-03-18 03:11:47.274939

I think part of the toxicity is that so many more people are YOLOing their entire portfolio into GME as to it becomes a near $ROPE or Lambo situation   Then you have those not vested in GME that are sick of all the GME posts and then you have the HF bots   Only gamble with what you're willing to lose   I'm still holding my GME because this is a once-in-a-lifetime event but it's only 50% of my portfolio   The rest of it is in other failed WSB DDs such as RKT PLTR BB MT JDST/JNUG and betting against the mouse   Also keep in mind this place exploded from 1 5 million to 9 6 million    And the Mods Ape bless their souls have kept this place together like MacGuyver builds an ICBM   Duct Tape and Memes   Yet even with all this?  WSB is still one of the best subs here ,2021-03-18 03:12:37.200134
I agree a 401k is more flexible in trying to out perform inflation and less risky in terms of potential bankruptcy  However most pension plans are insured so even if the company did go bankrupt people would still get most if not all of their pension payouts  Additionally the rate at which most employers contribute toward pensions is much higher than what they contribute to 401ks  Most employers will match 401ks at 2-3% at most I’ve seen 4 5-5%  While most pensions will contribute between 5-14%  Which means those with pensions are generally setup with much more potential income at retirement age compared to those with 401ks    For the most part pensions out perform inflation by several percentage points yearly  From 2015-2020 pensions rose at an average of 7 4% a year while inflation grew at 1 53%  Which also doesn’t factor in the annuities that most people who get pensions have ,2021-03-18 03:12:39.240979

Short squeezes and gamma squeezes often occur in tandem but are fundamentally different phenomena  In short:  Short squeezes are when an individual or groups of individual are short a stock and the price rises enough such that they must cover in order to contain losses  The covering process can drive the price up in the process   A gamma squeeze happens when a stock rises enough such that the net delta of call options and put options rises to the point where the market maker who wrote these option contracts must purchase the underlying security to maintain delta neutrality  The process of purchasing the underlying trigger a virtuous cycle of 1  Increasing stock price -> 2  increasing net delta -> 3  MM must purchase more as hedge which -> goto 1  &#x200B;  What we have been seeing with GME is a combination of gamma and short squeezes ,2021-03-18 03:12:53.024075

with Gamestop it's already evident what can be done; take a look at Gamefly it's still a thing   Gamestop needs to either be bought out by them or by them and make gaming easier     Digital games are the way of the future since downloading makes things easier and takes up less hardware on one's shelf granted I'm one of those people who likes shelving since my and my wive's cats like tall places     At the same time personalities on youtube and other sites can praise a game for all it's worth saying it's the next hot thing when in reality it's not   that's why I like Gamefly you can test it out and if it's worth it   For me if I am not impressed by a game within an hour or so of play time then I don't care about it and it's marked off my list    The only way that AMC could be better is by buying a streaming service similar to what the Syfy blastr site has or IMDB and re-invent itself with streaming   Charge less then what any of the other streaming giants are currently charging   Currently; AMC does have a streaming app but it's not well built    They do that they fix it and make it marketable they could remain relevant for about another decade or so   They have the movie pass and the stubs pass; charge 20-30 dollars a year 30 for Movie pass which is a free hall pass essentially for movies and 20 for Stubs which is the same but you get points for movies you watch   Re-work them as programs   Stubs would be remain same price 20 or so for a year you can watch movies streaming but because it's a lower price paid you can't watch day of movie coming out you have to wait 24 hours and then you can watch it   Movie Pass charge 30 or so per year and you can see any movie at any time even older movies from times past or their metropolitan opera stuff they do on occasion plus their specials like anime one night only's and things of that nature ,2021-03-18 03:13:40.702814

I get that they both showed signs of a squeeze before trading was halted back in January but I am curious if anyone has data showing the possibility of another squeeze for amc! Gme seems to have an increasing chance to squeeze even bigger but for the rest of us apes that are still holding amc I am curious as to the possibility of amc squeezing again! To me it seems like a lot of movement in the stock and basically a mirror image of gme! So my thoughts are if gme squeezes again than amc will do the same! And with the theaters opening up than that is also adding pressure to the hedge funds to settle there short positions! Does anyone have anything to add or am I the only one thinking the same way?!,2021-03-18 03:16:17.083761

Man we are talking about more than half of working adults save nothing  You can’t justify that  It isn’t possible  Maybe a very small percentage has literally nothing left  But most have some discretionary  And that doesn’t make me out of touch  That’s just name calling when you feel bad about your situation  I didn’t do it to you  Don’t be mad at me    And in your case you certainly can find $20 a month out of the $500 extra you have to save  If not it isn’t a matter of not being able to save  It’s not wanting to save  Good luck in life  Hopefully your life turns super positive soon ,2021-03-18 03:19:20.317723

Or total market index funds  VTSAX FZROX also FNILX FZILX  Market will be in the gutter but if you expect it to go back up at some point betting on the market as a whole is safer than any single company  Not as sexy as any single-company stock but [lots]https://thepowerofthrift com/thriftygals-money-strategy/ of Financial Independence Retire Early [folks]https://www mrmoneymustache com/2011/05/18/how-to-make-money-in-the-stock-market/ love it   Just need 25 times your annual expenses to be set [forever]https://www mrmoneymustache com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/ and less if you are willing to draw on principle and let your accounts hit $0 when you die leaving nothing to inheritance  So if you're somewhere low cost of living where $20k/year leaves you set you're good with $500k invested  If you happen to be able to sell GME for $1MM immediately throw half of it back in to index funds then as a super conservative move if you want to be absolutely sure you're covered on taxes aka you don't reinvest your taxes to see it crash further before you withdrawal it the other $500k is kept in a savings account  Next April you pay $300k 30% in taxes and you keep the $200k as your living money to draw off of as needed  At $20k/year that will last you a decade hopefully by which point the market has recovered and it's safe to start drawing from your investments again,2021-03-18 03:19:43.577872
