using an estimated average of 270 00 they afford about 2 2 mil shares to short  probably have been spreading it out rejecting peaks like 350/280 now 250 etc likely even covering some on the lows to take profit and regroup for another short attack  Pair this with put hedges and you get days like today and last wednesday ,2021-03-15 23:08:05.761029

Literally so disgusting  Just go offer to suck the nearest cop to you off since you love the state so much  Property law is protected by violence or the threat of it  The state is currently the wielder of the violence  Do you think they are the only ones that can retard? Who REALLY owns your land in the current system you or the state?  No your wages are decided with taxation as a factor because you're a poorfag lol  Not mine   Taxation is theft through and through  You're a retard if you can't see that as fact  It isn't an argument ,2021-03-15 23:08:16.602533
A split would work in reverse so in my case id owe 1000 shares rather than 500   However on split the price would fall so generally you'd end up near some equilibrium point   I assume the short basis adjusts as well   For a split GME would have to announce 10 days in advance its not like they can just drop it on people   I think that's plenty of time for folks to close their positions or further hedge with long calls    The reality here is GME isn't worth 250 a share its debatable whether its worth 40$ a share  And sure everyone who has bought shares can hold indefinitely but in that scenario the price still drops its not like there's a ton of new buyers showing up to to bag hold until the grave    Right now the float isnt high enough and if these folks shorted near the 300$ mark well you've got a lot of ground to cover to force a margin call on them under those circumstances assuming they didnt do what I did and buy long calls to limit losses on the short position and margin calls which seems like a no brainier ,2021-03-15 23:08:16.602616

put contracts are basically the reverse and give you the right to sell 100 shares at a specified price strike price    so these are just instruments that do what they do and people use them in different ways  Apes and retards use them to make insane bets that either burn their cash or explode into generational wealth    A more conventional use would be to use them as a sort of insurance policy  If you are sitting on 1000 TSLA shares back when it hig $800 that is an $800000 investment  Now let's say you get nervous that the price will tank but you don't want to ditch your shares  You might buy a $700 put contract  You pay for the contract similar to premiums when you buy insurance but then if TSLA tanks to $500 you still get to sell your shares at $700 so you paid a premium to limit your potential losses    FYI: there is a lot more to learn about options before burning cash on them  You can bet a stonk will go up buy a call be correct but still lose money e g  if volatility was high when you bought it and then goes down ,2021-03-15 23:12:33.130921

"My favorite is the story of Trevor Milton   It all began with a stock named NKLA a hydrogen truck maker that went public through a SPAC  Hype was built on WSB and 14$ options payed out 10 baggers  Hydrogen trucks would compete with TSLA a factory has been under construction for a while and soon things will ramp up   Millionaires made over night on this stock  It kept rising and rising till it was worth more than legacy auto makers and all was well   But disaster struck **citron did a short report**  In it they discovered horrific truths  - Trevor Milton's truck didn't exist  It was a prop he pushed down a hill and recorded to make investors believe the truck actually drove   - The ""tech"" he claimed to have didn't exist   - The ""factory"" being built didn't exist the field was empty and the ground wasn't even broken   - Worse Trevor Milton was exposed as a prolific scam artist who did similar scams before   - Because of this the SEC opened an investigation into NKLA and Trevor   NKLA stock drilled but WSB rejoiced  It thought it found a unicorn everyone could buy puts and be rich on a stock that should be worthless! An infinite money cheat!  People loaded up on puts EOD and waited for tendies ton show   But they did not show NKLA kept going up  It went up and up for weeks and any drills were temporary  It had been pumped by traders who were also buying Hertz stock   WSB was caught in a YOLO that made sense too much sense for the 2020 covid market  NKLA was seen as a ""discount value stock"" and that Citron were liars and the SEC would find nothing   WSB got worn down over time and forced to exit their positions   And that is how WSB lost to a scam artist who built a Fred Flintstone truck ",2021-03-15 23:14:13.413111

Buy PLTR  It’s a Tesla situation  Hype has died but when people actually understand what they do and how valuable their software is ppl will pile in hard  I bought Tesla sub 200 pre split  Innovative value plays only  I went big on Palantir and will continue to buy  In Peter thiels book he mentioned that he was working in a business that will monopolize an entire industry that doesn’t exist yet  The business was Palantir  The industry was telling the future with simulations  No competition  They are completely industry agnostic and applicable to all business  They even saved BP over a billion dollars for a cost of less than 100 mill  That is value in software ,2021-03-15 23:14:19.410783

"You should do some more studying but the basic principle is this:  If there are more people trying to buy than sell the buyers have to buy shares at the ask  Thus they're eating away at the ask side which increases the price   If there are more people trying to sell they're having to eat away at bids in order to continue selling which lowers the price   If it were as simple as ""volume always has two sides"" the price of every stock would never change  The key is which side bid or ask is initiating more trades ",2021-03-15 23:14:42.521736

An infinite money cheat!  People loaded up on puts EOD and waited for tendies ton show   But they did not show NKLA kept going up  It went up and up for weeks and any drills were temporary  It had been pumped by traders who were also buying Hertz stock   WSB was caught in a YOLO that made sense too much sense for the 2020 covid market  NKLA was seen as a ""discount value stock"" and that Citron were liars and the SEC would find nothing   WSB got worn down over time and forced to exit their positions   And that is how WSB lost to a scam artist who built a Fred Flintstone truck ",2021-03-15 23:17:44.137996

GME would not cause the system to collapse but it would expose how the system is manipulated   [This video explains how]https://www youtube com/watch?v=I0WXg5T3cBE the system could collapse if the SEC were to enforce FTDs   The concept is simple someone sells shares they don't have then they take that money out of the system buys a lambo 5th house   Entities manipulate the system to kick the can down the road and it is feared this could be a large percent of trades between 7-35% according to the video      We have no idea how bad it is   But if the theories are correct and looking at 2008 and all the shit they do I would not be surprised ,2021-03-15 23:18:25.826229

They can do anything they want   The reason the stock hasn't crashed back to the $40-$60 range is because damn near all the float is owned by retail   They've lost their power they just haven't switched to just straight options fuckery yet because they don't realize it yet   Last week's $4m put sink was evidence they are running out of real stock to borrow  They were testing it out   If a stock's float is 100% owned by people holding it regardless of a short squeeze it should rocket until people or institutions start selling ,2021-03-15 23:19:37.873237

"GameStop Stock Fell So Much It Had to be Halted  That Didn't Stop the Selloff  -- [Barrons com]https://Barrons com  Today 4:20 PM ET Dow JonesPrint  By Connor Smith   GameStop stock dropped suddenly Monday morning prompting a brief halt due to volatility  The stock fell wider than 15% to as low as $223 00 bounced back and then fell even lower   &#x200B;  Shares of videogame retailer GameStop ticker: GME this month have surged back near their late January levels this month  At the close GameStop stock was down 17% to $220 13   &#x200B;  The company said last week that Chewy CHWY co-founder Ryan Cohen and former Chewy executive Alan Attal were joined by Kurt Wolf managing member and chief investment officer of activist investor Hestia Capital Management on a new board committee aimed at transforming GameStop into a technology business   &#x200B;  Cohen kicked off GameStop's run by building a roughly 13% stake in 2020 and urged the company to pivot more toward e-commerce offerings  He joined the company's board with two associates in January sending GameStop shares parabolic in the weeks that followed  Analysts pointed to speculative options activity and the closing of some aggressive bearish bets from hedge funds   &#x200B;  Last month GameStop announced the planned departure of Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell  A person familiar with the matter told Barron's at the time that the company thought it was the right time and was looking for a new executive with a technology background   &#x200B;  GameStop's latest run began following a Feb  18 Congressional hearing on trading of its stock and Robinhood  The hearing included an appearance by Keith Gill the YouTube personality known as RoaringKitty who has developed a following for his successful long position in GameStop stock dating back to 2019; Gill revealed in a Feb  19 post that he doubled his GameStop holdings   &#x200B;  While some analysts are upbeat about the company's turnaround prospects the highest price target listed by FactSet is $33  That analyst Telsey Advisory Group's Joseph Feldman pointed to valuation concerns despite his ""high fundamental expectations and projected multiyear benefits from the transformation ""  &#x200B;  The company said it will report fiscal-fourth-quarter results next week  Like other so-called meme stocks favored by retail traders such results present a risk to the company's sky-high run-up    \#**That said trying to call a near-term top for GameStop has been a fool's errand especially for short-sellers facing unlimited downside **",2021-03-15 23:19:38.003065

Correct me if I'm wrong here   Kicking the can means they short   When they short they borrow stock sell it to drive the price down and get money in hand   They don't need much cash on hand to short it   Raising money means they are preparing to either cover their shorts or buy a fuck ton of options to cover their positions   It could also be preparing for the FTDs   Raising money seems like they're getting our tendies ready   🚀🌕🚀🌕,2021-03-15 23:21:23.435034
Original text:   Hey all I've been wary of a certain meme coin for a while  And I've been wondering why a wrinkle brain like Elon is pumping an inflationary joke coin  I digress    I now think people are so enamored with the idea that that certain meme coin is going to make them rich somehow that they're blind to what's really going on  And I'm pretty sure what's really going on is that Musk is pumping Sirius XM a company named after a star in Canis Major the greater dog  Elon's tweets yesterday mention Sirius and refers to the dog days of Summer  The dog days of summer idea comes from Ancient Greek/Roman belief that the return of the Dog Star was responsible for bringing heat and fever  And the dog days were marked by the return of Sirius each year  Then he and DFV tweeted about music  And SpaceX has already launched SiriusXM satellites  https://spacenews com/spacex-launches-siriusxm-satellite/ On Falcon 9  Which Elon tweeted about twice yesterday too  I think everyone is sleeping on something huge because of all the stupidity with that coin that must not be named  And SiriusXM is a low risk play to me  Cheap and potential that Elon pump catalyst happening  Not financial advice but this one gives me serious fomo ,2021-03-15 23:21:41.036156

Again they’ll just keep getting fined cause they’re gonna make the government way more money that way than just buying the shares so why stop the cash flow? This is my understanding and I might be missing something but idk  I don’t have a huge understanding of the system to that level so I couldn’t explain further but of the company recalls shares for multiple reasons then all the shares must be accounted for and there’s where shit WILL hit the fan but that’s as far as my knowledge will go and the rest would be speculation which I don’t wanna misinform  Probably someone here could explain better than I have but from what I understand and know if you keep holding you will make an absurd amount of money on this stock for sure ,2021-03-15 23:24:13.466198

The stock price is determined on how long apes hold  The longer apes hold the higher it goes  If every single ape set their selling limits to $500000 then the hedgies have no choice but to buy it at that price  I think it will last more than an hour but it could be a day or two  That’s why setting limits helps that way if you are not paying attention it will automatically sell it at that price  The squeeze will happen when least expected so no one know when  Just got to be prepared ,2021-03-15 23:24:39.989344

Expect another short ladder attack between the hours of 11AM and noon on Wednesday or Thursday   A decrease in 10% like we saw today kicks in the SSR rule so the stock can't be shorted for the remainder of the trade day and the following day   Last Wednesday it hit at 11:55AM  Today it hit around 11:15AM  The issue will be if they can acquire enough stock to short to do it twice between now and Friday or just save it up and go for the hail Mary on Thursday or Friday   I'm guessing 11AM gives enough time for them to see the trend and where to set their puts or they're just waiting for us to be on our crayon lunch break hoping to trigger as many stop loss trades on the way down ,2021-03-15 23:29:36.537106

You make really good points and I actually agree with most of it   On ‘fool proof enclosure’ in the tech world it is understood that as soon as something ‘fool proof’ is made they’ll just invent a better fool  They don’t even mean it sarcastically  Users will do things that go far and FAR beyond the reasonably expected behaviour of what someone in that position is intended to do  And for reasons that defy explaining  Astronauts have a proverb to celebrate that kind of thinking: there’s no situation so bad that you can’t make it worse   What you can’t do is to ‘plan for all eventualities’  A you have no idea what that would mean B you couldn’t possibly afford to C you will have missed whole categories of stuff that you had no idea somebody would try   What you can do is build protocols with regards to the environment the cage the walk ways the animals the people etc and have general strategies to handle those  “When trouble starts immediately separate all the humans from the animals; send the animals to their pens; close off certain areas; break out the emergency equipment which would always have a tranquilliser gun or some such; call an ambulance etc  You give people a plan and then you train on those plans  Plans are always realistic and manageable and they are trained for so that everybody understands what the plan is in any given situation why colleagues do what they do what the likely outcome is what to watch out for  That’s responsible   As far as Harambe is concerned I would not kill him    1  Harambe is an alpha male he is the strongest in the troupe  He knows that  A kid is not going to challenge that  Harambe understands that kids can be brats he will understand that this is a human child he is not going attack it  I just invent a system with operand conditioning: suppose someone falls into the enclosure the animals need to be distracted  How do you distract them? By making them understand they get a special treat: their favourite food I have no idea what that would be someone at the zoo would understand what that looks like  How is that message conveyed? By playing a piece of music that is only ever and exclusively used for that occasion  They know: when that music plays the **BEST TREAT IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE** is waiting for them  Come’n get it! Food is an incredibly strong incentive for an animal  The kid might be interesting but if it’s not attacking if it’s not really doing anything how important can it really be? It’s certainly not important enough to let the other lesser individuals get a stab at the tasty morsels first  That kid is just not important enough in comparison   2  I don’t kill Harambe not even if he harms/kills the child  My stone cold reason: there’s plenty more humans than there are gorillas and the gorillas never asked for any of our bullshit   3  By killing Harambe we place the onus of our extremely poor planning behaviour and upbringing on the animal  The animal was not doing anything other than going through its day in an enclosure that it would not seek for itself  What do we do: when we make a mistake the animal gets to pay for it with its life  It is as quintessentially human as you can get: I didn’t do it it’s not my fault  And if it is I don’t want to pay for it  And if someone else has to be absolutely shitcanned to get there so be it   4  By killing Harambe we are sending the message: you don’t have to worry about anything  If you do something bone-headedly stupid the animal will pay for it  Humans don’t have to learn the lesson  If Harambe had harmed/killed the child and I don’t believe that he would have and the zoo’s response was: people listen you can’t just walk into enclosures with wild animals  These are wild animals they do their own thing we’re not going to kill an animal that was just going through its day  We regret the loss of life killing another life is not going to make it better  It would teach visitors that they had to pay attention it is never a bad thing to apply situational awareness but more importantly: that they will be expected to show restraint and not do anything stupid  I can tell you right now there won’t be too many kids trying that stunt again   There was a movie about a man in a zoo who absolutely had to stick his arm through the fence to taunt the lion  Yes he actually did that somebody was filming that  The lion being an apex predator starts mauling the man’s arm  Because: obviously? Are you going to kill the lion? Is it the lion’s fault the man is too stupid to live like: literally? Is the mere fact that he’s interacting with an adult apex predator not of and by itself enough of a signal? This is an adult man by the way this is not a child  Again the enclosure could be better secured that was definitely an issue but again: not the lion’s problem and an easy warning for the man to behave himself we cannot hold the animals responsible for our stupid mistakes  It is unfair to put that onus on them  We should and do know better we should not do these things of which we know they will turn out bad for us if we insist on trying   Asian families go to Yellowstone Park  To commune with nature  They believe the bison are tame  So they visit them all smiles for a photo opportunity  Bison are extremely protective of their young and their herd  Male bison can weigh 900 kg and move at 60km/h  You’re actually being chased by a freight train coming at you at full tilt   Harambe should not have been killed  It wasn’t his fault  He did not ask for it he was not responsible his range of behaviour is limited to what his instincts and group dynamics taught him  Asking for cogitation and ‘reasonable’ responses from the perspective of humans is stupid on a level we should be ashamed to ever admit to as the supposedly superior being on this planet this is obviously not aimed at you this goes to the wider humanity and I’ll hasten to say that I’m not exactly on my first dumbass mistake in my life just so we’re clear on that ,2021-03-15 23:30:28.824631

Hey fellow monkeys! I'm a WSG OG signed up last January and heard of this little place from Twitter  I want to keep buying GME but I have to give you all an ultimatum  I'm autismkin and self-diagnosed myself with low-functioning autism  Can you please stop saying the r*tard word? I literally shake and shit myself when I see that word  We're here to make a change and stick it to hedgies  Can you fellow monkies work with me and start a revolution against the bad words?,2021-03-15 23:30:45.675820

"The problem with shorting a stock when you're a hedge fund or perhaps lack of a problem for them is that they don't have to buy back the shorted share  They can hide them in ETFs hide it in a call/put spread hide them in reaaaally far OTM calls if you have a short it's an agreement to buy a stock at a lower price in the future when you buy a OTM call you are making an agreement to buy a stock at a higher price in the future so they cancel because technically you have a right to both and you say ""but look I don't really have a short because I have a right to buy this stock at this date!"" What they're doing now is undercutting the price correct and what will EVENTUALLY happen is they will be forced to cover their shorts  Every short borrowed share has a daily fee   7~ % for today for example so technically we can hold our shares indefinitely until they run out of money to maintain their positions  Or a share callback happens for a board meeting  There could be a stock split  All reasons shorts would have to cover  For now all we do is buy and hold  Its the recipe to success ",2021-03-15 23:30:51.896379

Low volume just means low volume   lack of interest/volatility     After months of watching this insanely awesome stock bounce all over   this is the calm before the storm   If there really were paper-hands selling right now   they are the ones that day trade only     They never had diamond hands just day traders looking for volatility and it didn't show up   They'd be in at 250 out at 300 taking the little greasy tendie at the bottom of our buckets   instead they did nothing and walk away with less today   I'd be curious to know how many of us there are on WSB in the stock   Is there any way to see traders with < $1M in the stock? or <$500k in the stock?   If those are selling/buying on the day   that would show the paperhandedness of the day   We need a paperhanded-ness chart!,2021-03-15 23:31:30.328367

Expect another short ladder attack between the hours of 11AM and noon on Wednesday or Thursday   A decrease in 10% like we saw today kicks in the SSR rule so the stock can't be shorted for the remainder of the trade day and the following day   Last Wednesday it hit at 11:55AM  Today it hit around 11:15AM  The issue will be if they can acquire enough stock to short to do it twice between now and Friday or just save it up and go for the hail Mary on Thursday or Friday   I'm guessing 11AM gives enough time for them to see the trend and where to set their puts or they're just waiting for us to be on our crayon lunch break hoping to trigger as many stop loss trades on the way down ,2021-03-15 23:31:37.998907

Realistic price expectation for a surge before the NSCC liquidates all shorts and like five different hedgefunds all go bankrupt is $2600  However if it doesn't happen this week its likely to drop back down to 100 and trade sideways all the way until July because OI / PRC / Max Pain      Hedge funds are ran by psychopaths  Their immunity to psychological fatigue is their greatest strength  Time is on their side  Don't get attached to dates  If this run does end try to get out above your cost basis  And when it plummets back to Earth buy the fuck back in hard and forget you even own any GME  The hedgies are arrogant and absolutely will put their neck back in the noose ,2021-03-15 23:31:43.219647

These cunts fucked up when they triggered my stop loss in that flash crash last Wednesday   Not only did I buy more I haven't even used my stimulus yet  Not stop loss this time    Push it down further bitches  The lower they manipulate the stick the more I'll buy and hold    Looking forward to a sale this week ,2021-03-15 23:35:40.535507
Thank you  So this isn't really a big deal as it's less than  5% of the company   Maybe just a cash grab to invest before this stimmy hits ,2021-03-15 23:35:40.535602
this has always been a battle between institutions  we don't have the power you think we do   it crashed in january not because robinhood halted trading but because big players like Fidelity got out of GME completely and dumped all their shares on the market  that's it   fact is Citadel is still borrowing cash  they haven't covered  all we have to do is hold ,2021-03-15 23:35:41.988198

Playing devil's advocate would not be surprised if all these catalysts occur that are good for longs but the price does nothing would not be surprised if govt allows anybody caught too deep in their shorts to just quietly close it out with the promise to not do it again  Either today was more shorting or some whales that are long getting out of their positions ,2021-03-15 23:35:50.701242

Did they buy your shares? They certainly didn't buy mine  That means that they didn't close their shorts  I suppose if there was one guy holding the last few shares they needed to cover that they could probably come up with some strategy to make up for those losses but as far as I can tell there is an army of apes all holding on ,2021-03-15 23:36:39.494238

Sure   It's only 15k trades   If it was in the millions then ok   I mean if u compare the volume to how many users are in wsb it makes sense   Like gme has a volume of 20 million and theres 9million users on wsb   Thats basically just 2 trades per user     If everyone here stopped buying gme cause they think gme is tanked then bam volume goes down to less than 10 million easily ,2021-03-15 23:38:42.296114

To be honest no ER can justify the kind of run GME has had since it's last ER and stop it from dropping  Maybe if they announce that they bought out AMZN or some big name like that then we can expect it to go up   No matter how much we like the stock we need to set realistic expectations for ourselves and others that might get effected  Only then we can prepare for what's to come and plan how to overcome those challenges and hurdles ,2021-03-15 23:39:35.035188

It’s going to be **REALLY REALLY** bad before it gets insanely good   $60 billion means they have enough money to short the stock 6-10x over  Meaning they can get it down to *literally pennies* even with buying resistance from retail and other larger funds   If people keep holding then they’re truly fucked  $50k/share would not be a meme anymore  However what’s the likelihood people will diamond hand through when the stock drop down to *pennies*?  Personally I’m already playing with only house money so I can hold to $0 and not flinch  So I’m holding forever  I’ve set my WeStock notice to $500/share just so I can get notified when it happens and manually check like once or twice a week ,2021-03-15 23:39:39.957932

You don't just stop shorting and switch   You have to cover your short ie buy shares   GME only has 50 million tradeable shares  not a lot and estimates on short very from a lot to a holy fuckton amount   Remember the goal was to make Gamestop a Blockbuster and they didn't   With bankruptcy no short has to cover   they just reap absurd profits   Gamestop isn't bankrupt and is now in a very healthy transition and it is very likely that there are not enough shares to cover ,2021-03-15 23:39:54.713886

Thanks for challenging me!    I’m using iborrowdesk com as a sentiment gauge  High available shares = low chance of shorting versus low available shares = high chance of shorting especially when the trends on iborrowdesk com justify the change in stock price     As for Ape sell off I don’t think this had a major impact considering the volume was 350K at the peak of sell off and we saw almost identical changes in shares available to borrow     I think some good question for retail bears is    how do you explain the low volume with change in share price? low volume usually means rising price as the market maker adjusts the ask price to incentivize trading — they make money off volume    How do you explain the sharp increase from $50 to $200 on 2/24? Someone was forced to buy and it wasn’t retail  Those retards didn’t jump in until 2/26 - 2/27 the only other time we’ve had significant volume at 20M    There are a lot of big indicators that someone is really fucked and it’s kind of hard to ignore ,2021-03-15 23:40:17.955443

Hedge funds going bankrupt doesnt prevent the fact that positions must be covered and shares must be bought/sold  A contract is a contract  What will happen is the market makers who wrote the contracts will be on the line for them and if they cant afford to cover - the banks will  If the situation gets SO out of hand that the banks can't help? Insurance  The US banks have a 60 trillion dollar insurance plan for this reason   For now my plan is 💎👐 I can't tell you what to do with your stocks  This is a free for all  Realistically and I'll probably be downvoted for this I'll be selling my first share out of 5 at 1000 and every 500 interval after that Ill sell a share   The best course of action is to always hold a stock until the fall after a peak because you could sell on the way up at only 10% of where the stock will actually go  It's hard to tell how far a stock will climb when fundamentals are ignored its easy to tell when its returning to normality   The main thing to remember is we all did this to make money  You have to ask yourself how much money would you be comfortable with making where the feeling of missing out on potential further gains doesn't really outweigh what you made  For me all I want is to give the 🖕 to the same hedge funds that put my family through a very tough time since 2008 and make enough money to allow myself to not have to work during my final year of college ,2021-03-15 23:41:16.667200

Margin doesn't do that  If you have a stock that's 100% of your portfolio it can raise above 100% in the calculation for some reason  My guess is because portfolio value is updated asynchronously from the stock value so it does something like account value/shares owned*share price to calculate the percentage where account value can be a little old  If the stock goes down it typically shows over 100% for a second or so and that's my best guess as to why ,2021-03-15 23:41:19.579201

If you buy a call you don't *have to* buy any of the shares but you can  If you exercise the contract then you buy all 100 for the agreed upon price strike price  So all contracts either will or will not be exercised for all 100 shares  If they're not exercised it's because there was no point e g  you have a contract saying you can buy shares from me for $20 a piece but you could get them for $17 a piece on the market and so the contract just expires worthless and disappears ,2021-03-15 23:44:35.937593

NOK is trading about $4 30 at the close today   Let's say you pay  07 for your $5c 3/19   One contract is 100 shares so you pay $7 plus commission for per contract   The strike price of $5 is out-of-the-money which means it is ALL premium   There is no intrinsic value   If you bought the $4 call it is  30 in the money  The intrinsic value is the current market value minus the strike price   Premium evaporates for the duration of the option and at expiration you have only intrinsic value for an in-the-money option or zero value for an out-of-the-money option because the premium is all gone   To break even on the $5c 3/19 option the stock would have to climb  70 to reach the strike price plus  07 to pay for the option premium you paid plus a little extra for the commissions   NOK stock would have to climb a little more than  77 in four days   That's about an 18% increase in four days just to break even   Any closing price over $5 07 would get you a profit minus commissions   At the same closing price on expiration the $4c will be 5 07 in the money and that's what you could sell the option for   If you don't sell it the broker may automatically exercise it and you will buy 100 shares of NOK for $400 per options contract   If you don't want to do that be sure to sell the option before closing ,2021-03-15 23:44:54.057695

I usually would be happy to see another ape holding but if these profits can help you wipe away accounts in collection maybe you should consider selling maybe one or two shares to give you some room  We always say only put in what you can afford to lose and if you’re in collections well that’s the definition of money you can’t afford to lose  Gme can moon and I hope it does but it can also tank and tank hard like 3 weeks ago and that wouldn’t be good for your marriage    Good luck bro whatever you decide ,2021-03-15 23:46:21.517377

GameStop isn’t a publisher  GameStop isn’t an eSports provider  GameStop isn’t a console manufacturer  GameStop’s legacy business of “used gaming” is nosediving   GameStop until recently has be incinerating cash to mall leases for stores that barely turn a profit   Yes I think GameStop will be a major video gaming hub and Ryan Cohen is a genius @ $14B it is completely speculative and contingent that this guy turns around a sinking ship    $5B yeah I’d be okay with that but GME is worth $14B based on a successful Pet-Food retailer founder-team that hasn’t produced a plan yet? No fucking way   If Ryan Cohen himself doesn’t come into that  earnings call clearly defining the path to success and transformation with quantitative forecasts and growth targets this stock is going to absolutely plummet    I’m bullish on GME but at this current price you need to understand it is NOT even CLOSE to any fundamental value  That’s okay the price is a reflection of failed market mechanics but don’t fool yourself that this thing is going to maintain this price for very long  Either retail gives up or hedge funds give up  The price will either swing up then down or just down ,2021-03-15 23:46:54.871427

If you believe RC can transform GME into a powerhouse than any price up to $1-2k per share is a deal; that is if you intend to stay in for the long haul 3-5 years  How anyone can look at what he & his team were able to do with Chewy and not price in innovation & fmv is beyond me  That's why this earnings call is so crucial  Everyone has laser focused eyes on GME right now and it would be silly to assume that RC & GME haven't jumped on this opportunity and are in talks with everyone under the sun for deals/partnerships/pivots/debt consolidation/etc  They're probably doing every possible thing in order to set GME up for rapid growth and transformation   The end of this week and next week is going to be wild ,2021-03-15 23:47:02.293392

I will likely get downvoted for this but given open interest and IV I think the current party is over  GME will drop to some new normal likely around 100 a share    At that point we wait a month IV calms down and it spikes due to gamma up to some value   As long as those spikes continue to be 100%+ this cycle will repeat ,2021-03-15 23:47:57.501437

No I’m sorry that’s just nonsense   First where we are today is a direct result of a Congress and the government that knows no limits on its power  Almost nothing the government in Washington spends money on is constitutional and therefore legal   Second the “inadequate tax policy“ against which you rail had the amusing effect of increasing total revenue to Washington so the idea that more or higher tax rates are needed in order to make up a shortfall is ridiculous   The problem is the spending  It’s ALWAYS the spending  The government has no money it has only what it takes from productive people by force  Taxes are not investments they always result in a loss of productivity and a loss of buying power  Taxation and government spending are the least efficient ways of achieving anything and for that reason should be kept at the barest minimum something nobody in Washington and far too few citizens understand ,2021-03-15 23:55:12.418375

And how exactly do you know that we are the ones buying those 800 calls? might aswell be the hedgies i hardly see redditors buying far otm calls  the 19/3 800calls alone make up for 25% of the float let's say hedgies own 20% so IF GME were to hit 800+ by friday they have  1: hedged some of their losses on initial shorts  2: own 20% of the float that they can short and dump again   it seems far more likely that it's them buying those calls the volume and open interest on the 800s is so huge and we've said over and over again that you shouldn't expect the squeeze on any set date ,2021-03-15 23:56:52.336585

QE and lowering the fed rate decreased bond yields and increased their prices last year  This year inflation will begin to accelerate making growth stocks even more attractive forcing the bond market to increase yields and decrease prices in response  When bond prices and yields hit an attractive price point money flows into the bonds market to lock in a guaranteed 10 year return that will beat expected inflation  That’s what happened this past month  This periodic flow into the bond market will continue to occur periodically as bond prices and yields fluctuate which slows the decline of bond prices  But if inflation accelerates which it inevitably will given the current economic scenario bond prices will continue downward as high growth stocks will only become more sought after   So what does this mean? Will the fed rate is down keep buying growth stocks   Want to get fancy and make guaranteed money in the bond market? Short long term treasury bonds Buy TMV,2021-03-15 23:57:52.297582

My guess at the ER next week they will announce Cohen as CEO and CFO and hopefully announce the recall  GME launches right then and there ,2021-03-15 23:59:08.344230
The best case scenario right now would be for the WSB crowd to take profits selling their shares back to shorts at these inflated prices  Let it come back down to 70-80 range and then buy back twice as many shares and wait for the next HF whale to make a play and let it rip like last time  Keep doing the same thing over and over buying dips and selling rips and everyone can double up their share count each time with enough profit left over to save every species of ape ,2021-03-15 23:59:12.528338
"That would be fine but the problem is that they cant even get a legitimate share to trade   All the stuff out there is FTD or the ""Float""   They couldn't just trade the same share 200000000 times without affecting the price  It would also take too long   The moment they get their hands on one real share it gets swapped with a FTD to satisfy an FTD that is waiting for their authentic share   Since they are the only ones who created the FTD they are the only ones who can satisfy the ""lack-of"" share    Think of it like this    someone is MISSING their share That the HF caused to go missing by shorting  Once the shorter buys a share it does not become their share it's used to satisfy their debt of a share   So it's not like they actually have a share to re-sell again unless they short another share    again    putting them right back at the missing share    again ",2021-03-15 23:59:12.529001

If I can get my hands on a table of Level 2 data I think taking a sum of all the buy limit orders and averaging the price will give a much better idea of what the shares are actually worth to the majority of people  Well at least those with limit orders set  Simple math will show that the the average of these is going to be higher than the last trade price   This won't be perfect because a lot of apes don't even have limit sell orders set  But it's better than seeing the price that the HFs are trying to make us thing other apes value the stock at   I have level 2 data with my broker but I can't export it to Excel  If any other ape has this data and willing to share feel free to send it my way and I will run some numbers ,2021-03-15 23:59:53.230707

This is laughable   Did you know 1 share last year is only worth 1/4 of a share now? Yes they diluted their shares that much in the past year taking advantage of retail   Even if they are successful it won't warrant more than $1 per share unless something radically changes long term from the trend pre covid   They were $4 dollars pre covid and there is not new game plan they are doing now that warrants their price being higher than pre covid   Once all the hype is over whether 3 months from now or 3 years from now you will be left with a $1 dollar stock at most ,2021-03-15 23:59:59.123083

Listen here dick-breath; I’m fully aware of the “transformation” of GME  I’ve been long shares since August of 2020 and have followed this saga very closely since   GameStop isn’t a video game publisher   GameStop isn’t an eSports company   GameStop isn’t a console manufacturer   GameStop’s biggest revenue stream used games is taking a Drill Team Six nosedive   Ryan Cohen a genius and innovator with his crew of Chewy execs have a massive task of essentially building A BRAND NEW BUSINESS    Can they do it? Absolutely  But at $14B market cap with NO strategic roadmap defined and with all the headwinds they face from their existing brick-and-mortars you need to wake the fuck up and realize that GME is incredibly overvalued  Half of WSB is buying GME because stonks go up  or to prove a point to the “man”  Even if GME gets MOASS squeezed that cash will trade hands barely any of it will make its way into the actual business and anyone left bagholding will have to wait 456+ years to realize a $14B market cap   I’m long GME as a business but at this price point it’s retarded to buy for any reason other than scalping the technicals / momentum,2021-03-16 00:01:16.637969

There is no reasonable call option you can afford  And that is why your correctly state GME is over again   It may come back though but this round is over   When the calls get this expensive look at $200 or $300 calls on most of those stocks are expensive  Ones that move get real expensive ones that move like crazy like gme    Options are out of control price wise     So typical retail investors are unable to participate in the options side of the house   This then kills the gamma squeezes as MM stop having to buy more share to cover huge options positions  Infact it has the opposite impact  The Mm sell their coverage shares and poof it's like a short is pumping the market with shares but it's not it's just MM who don't need the protection anymore   Gme will burn back to 40/50 from here  Maybe make a new floor even higher and you guys will probably push the cycle again  Who knows how long it can continue ,2021-03-16 00:01:26.916313

Lol cool that’s your opinion  I’ll be back to gloat once it’s over  People like you thought $200 was impossible when it dropped to $50   DD is still ready to find for other stocks if you bothered to look  So far the only money I’ve lost is on options for boomer stocks based on DD I found on WSB the very thing you’re complaining you can’t find  You know which options made me money? GME and AMC   So really I think r/stocks or r/investing will be better for you if you need DD on the front page for some non-relevant stocks  There’s a reason everyone is talking about GME and AMC atm,2021-03-16 00:03:30.820868

Some astrology DD: the 19th will have significance for GME but so will late March/early April  In the upcoming day transit Mercury will cross over its natal Mercury from its IPO listing date  Mercury has various significations but most importantly it rules over stocks online exchanges and digital currency  I expect extreme volatility which will settle down until early April when Jupiter rules over abundance and money approaches Uranus sudden changes  More news may come out about GME and it's company's plans that will have more people flocking to the stock than ever before ,2021-03-16 00:03:34.954873

Not exactly  My understanding is that FTD occur when there is naked short selling i e  the hedgies are selling stocks to the market that don't actually exist  So normally when you short sell you're going to borrow a share from A to sell to B and then you give A an IOU for the stock you borrowed  But with naked shorting the hedgies basically write their *own* IOU without every borrowing anything and then they sell the IOU to B directly  They may even borrow it right back from B to cover their tracks so long as B is trading with a margin account  But the issue is that it's blatantly illegal for a hedge fund or anyone else for that matter besides market makers in specific circumstances to write IOUs in this way and sell shares that they haven't borrowed from elsewhere       As far as GME longs are concerned the FTDs are icing on the cake  The issue with the short position is that they wrote more IOUs than there are still shares available to trade because institutions and insiders are holding more than 100% of the float  The fact that some of those IOUs may have been written by themselves just makes their behavior blatantly illegal on top of being insanely risky       P S  not a financial advisor not an expert I just like the stock  Long GME,2021-03-16 00:04:32.993989

"To give credit where credit is due:  The attack plan looks like it was to line up stimulus drops to the pump of AMC to distract from GME since its a higher buy in and cheaper stock would be more accessible at 1400   If this was the case this was a smart attempt to amplify the after-effect of the attack on GME we saw today confidence wise  Amplify a shake on paper hand FUD convert  whole GME'ers to AMC'ers break confidence and divide apes against one another all by using this new money as the glint in the eye ctalyst  Well played since we're nearing end of quarter realignment AND the company press release which will both likely have more positive results than negative for GME poising it for a huge run soon IMO   Ultimately it was a very shitty band-aid for the shorts though  Eloquent plan but seems futile if us HODL'ers don't succumb to the current ""War of Attrition""   Remember that attrition isn't just financial  It's psychological  Somewhat Physical too if you're not used these hours or this kind of market fatigue and constant information absorbing  Or just have addictive habits   Always try to see the bigger picture and even more so avoid confirmation bias  The clearest picture is the right one not the one that looks best to you    And as always too always do whats best for you  Whatever that may be   Good Luck Friends",2021-03-16 00:04:47.738688

Vanguard's financial buissness model is simple elegant and unlike Robinhood's order flow bullshit not inherently positioned against the user  There is no inherent systematic paths to ethical temptations that could lead to illegal unethical or destructive shortcuts beyond the risks of access to tons of money in the first place  Most hedgefunds I would argue don't add anything useful to the country either on that same basis of judgement  What positive value was Kenny G providing the country when he bet to destroy Gamestop a company employing thousands with honest work?  And that more than anything else is how you can trust Vanguard over Technofrat Robinhood or any hedgefund any day   Honestly I would extend that filter to picking any buissness to patronage  Is the companies's buissness model set with or against it's user?  If it's set against its users it will fall to illigal behavior on purpose eventually no matter any official ethical standard ,2021-03-16 00:07:11.074131

> Is there ever a time where you try and buy a share and it tells you that you can’t because there’s not enough to go around?  yes/no   There is always a price in place for buying/selling a share  The change in price happens with supply and demand   If the people holding feel like their share is worth more they will have a higher price set   For those who feel like it's worth less their price will be less    Right now it's really weird  There is artificial supply and a reasonable demand   Hence why the price is where it is at   With this kind of demand lacking any artificial shares there is a potential just for argument's sake 5 times more demand than there is shares    Since the market has potentially 5 times MORE shares than there should be the supply is pretty darn high in comparison to the reasonably high demand ,2021-03-16 00:07:20.510605
Yeah that is a theoretical situation that can happen  Institutions hold stock too though a whole fucking lot of the stock  Big brokers like Fidelity and Vanguard hold MASSIVE amounts of the stock  It's up to them to decide how much is available to short from their holdings  They can loan their holdings to whomever they please  The more retail interest there is on the rest of the float however the less appealing it is to loan those shares out  Why would you loan something out for an interest payment when the underlying would make you more money anyway?  Also let say I'm on Vanguard  If I want to buy GME and there aren't enough shares to go around on the open market  They are going to sell me some of their shares  They are my broker so technically they can work it so they are both of our shares while I hold them and take the risk but they are on the hook then if it goes up  They already own the shares though too so it isn't a huge downside for them like it would be for a HF short  They just take your money when you bought the buyer pays the new higher price when you sell and they will happily facilitate that  That is one way a broker is different than a hedge fund   Hedge funds on the other hand need to borrow these shares from someone and they did it WAY before $40 a share was a thing  If they borrowed at $20 and it's at $200 now that's a 10 fold loss plus interest  They can try to sell at stupid low prices to each other all they want but the demand for shares exceeds $200 a share in value with retail and there is no float  So the price goes up instead of down  they may induce a dip but it gets bought back immediately ala last Wednesday   In other words as retail continues to buy and hold the more solidified the price gets  trades between HF's don't matter because they don't reflect the real market  Look at GME like gaming video cards right now  Yeah you might have an in to get them at MSRP through insider means but the general retail market remains inflated due to demand ,2021-03-16 00:07:22.052590

"230c means $230 is the strike point which means that once the stock value is over $230 u/VicTheRealest has the option but not the obligation to exercise his contract    If he exercises then he can buy 100 shares of $GME for $230/share no matter what the actual market value is    BUT just because the market value goes over 230 doesn't mean he is going to profit? Why? Because he had to pay a premium to purchase that call option  The premium is what you pay to buy the contract and it is nonrefundable--so worst case scenario the market value never hits the strike point 230 and the contract expires at market close on Friday 3/19    Now how does the premium work? It's likely that u/VicTheRealest paid a premium of $45 based on his estimate of GME hitting 275  So that means $45 per share which is 45x100 each option contract is for 100 shares  So his all-in cost for the contract is $4500 and that is his maximum loss    So at a premium of $45 and a strike of $230 that means that the market value has to hit $275 and go over 275 before he is making money  At this point he is ITM or ""in the money "" Say the stock shoots up to $300/share and u/VicTheRealest exercises his contract at that moment then sells those shares immediately this is a hypothetical  So that means that he is getting 300x100 shares MINUS the option price of 230x100 shares MINUS his premium of $4500  Total profit: $2500    The other choice he has instead of exercising the contract is selling the contract  By selling the contract he doesn't have to buy those 100 shares at a price of $23000 maybe he doesn't have the funds so he sells the contract to someone who can afford it  Gets back his premium and then some ",2021-03-16 00:08:48.069563

First off $4x100=$400  This is the premium  The premium is paid immediately and it is a sunk cost whether you exercise the contract or not  If you exercise the contract then you must purchase 100 shares at the strike price  This is why you look at the break-even price which is the strike price plus the premium In your scenario the stock would need to go above $114 to be worthwhile exercising the option ,2021-03-16 00:08:55.441638

I don't understand why everyone is saying it might take months or years? The whole play here is that there is a limited timeframe that these shorts have to buy back shares and return them to the institutions they borrowed from   The most pivotal GME shareholder meeting in decades is in June 3 months away   RC is making moves and there is every reason to have as many shares aka as many votes as possible before this meeting  Share callback date for those institutions that loaned shares out to shorts and must call them back to be counted as legitimate stock holders is something like April 19th  Don't quote me on that I recall seeing april somewhere and also retards laughing about 4/20 so it's probably the 19th :shrug:  All the DD's have said it will take weeks for shorts to cover due to the volume  April 19th is about a month away   Imo we should see MOASS start either end of this week or end of next ,2021-03-16 00:09:23.634828

It helps in identifying trends and reversals if you know what you’re looking for  Sure it fails but it can provide cues for where to buy and sell  A couple of really good analysts I follow on Twitter use basic tools and demand zones and they called bottoms and tops with near perfect accuracy in this correction  I’m still learning but I use MACD and slow stochastic along with a couple of other demand based indicators I’m starting with on a more advanced software ,2021-03-16 00:12:31.683411

They're not very big at all people have made Melvin and Citadel into these gigantic monsters that manipulate the entire world   they're pretty small companies in the grand scheme of it       Citadel is less than 1/100th the size of Fidelity or Vanguard for instance they don't actually have the magical powers people are pretending       But also companies borrow money all the time its really cheap to borrow right now it's unlikely they 'need' to borrow anything  They also probably don't even have GME position now or frankly ever did,2021-03-16 00:14:22.395124

Can I just say if you think you’re scared just go look at the volume and know there is no way the prices moved like that with that little volume  A couple may have paper handed but that’s ok  what you need to remember is your dd and if I’m fact you think they’re playing games and it has you a little unease’s   Just think of how unease they are right now not being able to sleep and just hoping they didn’t fuck themself even more  they are so worried knowing they just did more damage if it doesn’t work and a tiny bit of them is excited thinking you’re weak and dumb and you’ll fall for the trap   Don’t be that ape   We ride at dawn !,2021-03-16 00:14:29.031733

Indeed  Status? A warmongering nation of obese consumers who value celebrity over substance and have a disgusting concept of democracy   It's no surprise that a nation that was started by the gun continues to live by it   Bipartisan politics run by lobbyists a privatised central bank a vengeful prison system based on punitive measures rather than rehabilitation and a failed education and healthcare system for the majority  There is no status  The rest of the world knows exactly what you are ,2021-03-16 00:14:30.151426

Just how a satellite in high orbit around Earth doesn't fall to the Earth a satellite in orbit of the Sun won't fall to the sun  You have to remember that any satellite leaving the Earths gravitational influence will still orbit the Sun in around the same manner as the Earth in some way just like how if you jump out of a moving car you don't just fall straight down - you fly forward in the direction the car is moving  So reaching the sun requires delta-v for the retrograde burn ,2021-03-16 00:16:05.129257

I accept that there are other things that factor into a stock's price  The baseline of most stocks hovers around where its fundamentals lie but many things can distort that for periods of time   So if we accept that then we can see that there is strong evidence of a fundamental price around $40/50 if we accept DFV's DD but everything above that is speculation   So I'm curious as to why you are certain that this is a temporary dip and not a decline towards $40?,2021-03-16 00:16:34.388138

check out an options profit calculator such as [https://www optionsprofitcalculator com/calculator/long-call html]https://www optionsprofitcalculator com/calculator/long-call html  But yes standard options contracts cover 100 shares so one contract for a $250 strike from the OP's table would cost you $3045    According to that profit calculator in the link GME would have to hit \~$227 or so tomorrow for you to break even  But that breakeven number goes up as expiry approaches   Not financial advice I burn my tongue on lightbulbs regularly ,2021-03-16 00:16:38.844464

Calls and puts are contracts that gives you the *right* but not *obligation* to buy call or sell put at a certain price  Each contract covers 100 shares   4 important numbers here: strike price premium what you buy the contract at current market price and # of shares   For a call it's: Market Price - Strike Price + Premium  x # of shares  For a put it's:  Strike Price + Premium - Market Price x # of shares   Here's a couple examples of how they work   Let's say you buy 1 call at $7 per share or $700 premium since each contract covers 100 shares  The strike price is $10 and the current market value is $50    We get the equation     $50 - 10+7 x 100 which equals $3300 in value   *For Calls you want your Strike Price + Premium to be LOWER than market price for a profit*   Now for a put it's the exact opposite  Using those same numbers we get      10 + 7 - 50 x 100 which equals -3300  This put would basically be worthless  But let's say there's a huge crash and it crashes to $5     Well that's $1200 profit since the put says you can sell at $17 when market price is $5   *For Puts you want your Strike Price + Premium to be HIGHER than market price for a profit*  Disclaimer: I am by no means an expert at calls and puts and it's merely my understanding of them  The formulas may be wrong and other apes feel free to correct me as I am NOT a financial advisor   Note; you must apply through your broker to deal in calls and puts ,2021-03-16 00:18:16.141814

Why did you buy GME in the first place? If it's because of the impending short squeeze of a lifetime why would you sell now? Nothing about the squeeze situation has gotten worse for gme holders  Hedgies will do all they can to drop the price  It may even dip back down to 100 I don't know  But the reality is that eventually and nobody knows when they HAVE to buy back those shares that they shorted  And that will create tremendous buying pressure potentially shooting the price up into tens of thousands per share  Until then the price of the stock doesn't matter    Is it worth it to you to take $500 of gains and potentially miss out on $1M of gains? Sure you might lose that money entirely but imo the potential reward is much higher than the risk    Not financial advice am retard holding 27 @ $210 since January,2021-03-16 00:18:20.122449

The 30 45 is the price per contract  One call is 100 contracts   A call is the option to buy a stock at a given price at a specific point in the future    For example if you buy a 4/19 $380c for say $25 32 you would pay $2532 00 for the right to spend $380 x 100 on 4/19 for 100 shares  So technically the share price needs to reach 380+25 32=400 32 to break even  But if you never wanted to exercise the contracts anyway just sell the options to someone who does want to exercise them ,2021-03-16 00:20:50.991894

Sure you need to pay a fee to borrow the stock but then you collect a massive premium for selling the stock   All of their profit from shorting comes from the sale itself meaning they have been raking in revenue from shorting at $200+ so I kinda doubt this is where they needed their loan,2021-03-16 00:20:58.982821

"What do you think a stock is?  A piece of paper that arbitrarily fluctuates in value?  A stock's intrinsic ""value"" is proportional to the companys future cash flows   People buy shares to stake out a percent ownership in a business for the sake of sharing in that company's profits   A business that isn't profitable will not be able to provide dividend yield nor growth in the future given a healthy unmanipulated market   You can get an army of crayon eating dolts to bubble the price of anything   But at the end of the day reality always sets in baggie ",2021-03-16 00:21:00.741833

It's nowhere near 500M I have no idea where he got that but that would be about double the total shares  They once held ~38% of shares but sold off a bunch last December and now own less than 10% of the shares  Souce: https://www mingtiandi com/real-estate/outbound-investment/wanda-sells-off-control-of-amc-theatres/,2021-03-16 00:21:05.515701

No largest short sellers not just hedge funds have much more cash and leverage than retail   They can write calls trade spreads “cover” a little to drive price up and hold while retail catches the hotpotato then place massive put orders and tank the price like what happened today   All retail can do is      buy and hold   ,2021-03-16 00:21:27.116398

Not everything is a short squeeze  AMC went up 2 weeks ago when they announced that New York was opening up theaters  AMC started going up further last week when they announced California LA theaters would start opening up this week Monday-Wednesday   LA and NY are the biggest movie theater markets  This isn't going to hit triple digits  My price target was $15 but with retards YOLOing stimi checks I might hold for $20   Been buying since it was in the $4 60s and after the squeeze in January when I was too dumb to sell I bought more around the $7 mark  My average cost is $5 66 ,2021-03-16 00:21:40.519774

That's a possibility  I would be willing to bet at this point they need to rebuild the ramp  Basically a round 3  I don't think an MOAS situation is beneficial for them  Because MOAS isn't good for them they probably just want to cycle this situation once or twice more  I truly believe this will fizzle out instead of a giant squeeze eventually the original DD does not describe the situation we are in now nor a situation that is beneficial for long whales who will drive this doubt they want to drive it off a cliff  For that reason I don't think we will find out what's beyond 480 or maybe even 350  Still good money to be made ,2021-03-16 00:22:19.084100

Like the title implies im new to this and im risking all my previous Karma  I'm trying to learn more so it's worth it in my eyes  What is keeping WSB from becoming a HF in it's own right? Lack of funding? Is there a certain amount of donations or contributions it'd have to meet to be considered? Also would it require a figure head so to speak to control the investment strategies? Or is it because we are just dumb apes  Obviously I am    I've never been more intetested in day trading and the potential gains  I come from a poor family literally habe put blood sweat and tears in the work I do now to make it as well as I have thus far but the aspect of potentially giving my body a break and working out my mind as more than a hobby has hit me square in the jaw  Thanks to r/wallstreetbets I have gained double my initial investment maybe pure luck  Actually 99% pure luck  I know losses will come but I'm ready to dive into it all although not without a dive plan    I have had a couple drinks to be quite honest otherwise I probably wouldn't have had the courage to bring up this discussion  My mind is my only insecurity honestly ,2021-03-16 00:22:31.557791

Just 'cause a few people are making the mistake:     Bond Issue is always listed as the full value it's not the number of Bonds  It's not like a Stock where its price\*issued     Each bond is worth $1000 each at maturity however despite being denominated in $1000 bond prices are always listed out of 100       So it is $600 million not $60Billion       Also companies borrow money all the time especially when money is cheap and it is right now them issuing bonds is not indicative of some financial crisis ,2021-03-16 00:23:07.786764

You're missing the important details though   The number of shorts that need to be bought back and the ever increasing price it needs to happen at   Let's say BRK A is being shorted by just 1000 shares   Share price is currently close to $400k   If the vast majority of share holders refuse to sell for anything less than $1 million the protected cost to buy back those 1000 shares is not $400k x 1000 $400m   It's significantly closer to $1m x 1000 $1b   So when it comes time to start closing those shorts much more liquidity is required to start buying with the intention of hopefully buying enough at lower prices to not have anywhere near the protected losses   To put it in the most simplest terms if you knew you had to pay a massive bill soon on the repairs of your new crashed lambo but you don't know exactly how much and you know that when the bill comes that you HAVE to have cash for it or else there will be a hit put out on your wife's bf you're going to make sure you have cash on hand   Sure you won't sell your GME but you'll sell your yacht and private jet that you also got from GME tendies to ensure you can foot the bill when it comes due   We still don't know if the HFs fully covered their shorts probably not because why are there STILL ftd's?   But we do know they needed to liquidate positions to have cash on hand to buy as they go   You can't buy GME with shares of SPY   You can only buy it with cash   And you can only buy a fuck ton of GME with way more cash than what the market value would suggest   There's only like 50k shares that can be bought at once before the price spikes up by $100,2021-03-16 00:23:49.287500

I get that   but from my perspective   I’ve been DCA’ing into fake internet sudokus since before and through a massive crash and recovery   For years every time I put $100 in cb I always tell myself this money is gone   Might as well light it on fire   Do I need this money for x y or z?  If so keep it in my checking and don’t buy   Because of that I’ve never capitulated   Even last March when I checked my Blockfolio app for the first time in a while and saw I was down 80%   Never sold never will until it hits my price target to sell   Sure if you’re holding over 100 shares with a cost basis of <$200   a heavy retrace to <150 or $40 would suck   But I don’t use that money   my net worth calculator would be a bit depressing for a while   but the bills and mortgage would be paid on time my wife and I would still eat out or doordash when we wanted and we would still be financially stable   What’s I’m saying is   fuck the hedge funds   and you can crash that bitch to $4 a share   I’m not fucking leaving   The money is already gone   Don’t miss it   Told myself every time I bought a share I was basically burning it because I’m not selling or minimizing my position at all until $3500   and at that point I’m selling 15% to double my money and letting the rest ride to 10k plus   and I know the odds aren’t super high of that happening ,2021-03-16 00:23:50.596175

"One man's opinion:   Pre covid they were crashing because they had fallen out of favor and had run up crazy amounts of debt  People thought they were going bankrupt  They used the ""share dilution"" to raise hundreds of millions of dollars no interest since it isn't a loan to ensure they don't go bankrupt  Now with that out the window they can get to work finding new ways of getting money   WW84 was a complete mess  That movie alone will ensure all major studios release their blockbusters through the normal channels   People realized during covid how much they love going out and seeing movies  On demand and streaming is convient but not the same  This next year will be crazy with back to back to back monster releases   I don't own shares of AMC anymore  Closed all my positions today  I think it is a bit high and I wanted to lock in gains  I think $10 to $15 is a fair price eventually ",2021-03-16 00:25:36.413085

GME has 20% short of float according to Yahoo   So the chances of another big squeeze are diminishing   Eventually it will start trading on fundamentals   They have earnings coming up and floating between a $15-20B market cap   So if that went to $400/share it would be bigger than Best Buy and up there with some of the biggest retailers in the US with $6B in sales compared to $47B for something like BBY     Im not short but just pointing out facts  Be careful take profits and understand what you’re getting into if you’re tossing around big cash ,2021-03-16 00:25:41.632712

"In this monkey's opinion; They are requesting more liquidity for a reason  The timing is too suspicious as those funds were available on the 10th to use same day there was that massive ""sell off""  But they do offer out bonds on what looks like a two year basis if you go through their history of their other bonds    The BBB rating kinda makes sense as those bonds are not tied to any physical collateral and more susceptible to defaulting seeing as the money is used in a speculative highly liquid market  Imo they are worst than BigBananaBanazas but no one would buy them if they were lower ",2021-03-16 00:26:01.366530

I believe sticking on wsb will give you the impression retail holds more shares than it does and that those shares matter  Tbh we got in the way of the long whales in the first 480 event and if not for us they would have built their ramp better and squeezed it higher  The short side proved they now can stamp any push beyond large option payouts 350 so at least one long whale appears to have quit the game for now  This completely wrecks where my position was btw I expect I just lost money and will not get a payout  I have stocks calls and a put for after the squeeze  All will cost me now  I'm not falling for fud someone showed me it was the options data and the lack of green candles that tells me my bet was incorrect ,2021-03-16 00:27:19.387682

"That's not how it works  Low volume doesn't necessarily mean decreasing prices   You may have heard of the ""bid-ask spread""  What this describes is the gap between the lowest price stock being sold the ""ask"" and the highest price someone is willing to pay for the stock the ""bid""  In order for stock to be sold the bid and ask are expected to match   However the bid and the ask can move independently of each other  If sellers aren't satisfied with the prices they're getting they can increase the ask  If sellers want to buy the stock at this price they would have to increase their bid which would drive the stock price up  Driving the stock price up in this way does not depend on high volume ",2021-03-16 00:28:40.508977

Thank you for the info  Some of us apes coughcough me don't understand the whole bond tie-in  I was just asking someone else on another post who would buy these? They said big pension funds stuff like that  How can someone who is AT ALL in the $management arena not know what is going on and why would they buy? Perhaps this is why cnbc doesn't mention stuff - so these managers can claim ignorance when they beg for a bailout?,2021-03-16 00:29:55.788698

Info on shares held by public institutions is here:  https://fintel io/so/us/gme  You could theoretically add up all those numbers then subtract that number from the total number of shares available and that would give you the float  I could do it but math makes my head hurt    Now if you look at the float number consider how much of the “float” is owned by retail longs and daytraders and paperhands  This number except longs will always fluctuate    Now consider the number of shares shorted versus the number of shares in existence  Compare that to the float number  The shorted shares exceeds the float  The shorts are only able to cover the shares that are moving around via daytraders and paperhands  Which is a tiny number compared to the number of shares shorted    Someone has already done this DD  Right?,2021-03-16 00:29:56.386891

AMC 3/19 $6p  AMC 4/16 $6p & $10p  Why?  It's trading way above its precovid market cap at this point   Inb4 I'm full of shit just google AMC dilution and read the excellent articles that will do a better job than I will but if you don't understand what dilution is then know this AMC diluted itself by over 75% since covid started   This is as if a 4x split happened but no one got the extra shares and charts do not adjust for it   If you consider the precovid price to be say $8 in Nov 2019 adjusted for dilution that is $2 today   To put it another way when you adjust today's price to account for the dilution $14 is $56 $14 * 4 in 2019   Are you comfortable buying AMC at $56?

The fact that it hasn't seen a HUGE crash is incredibly bullish for the short squeeze scenario  yeah you're gonna have paperhands here and there but as time progresses there will be less and less float available to paper hands as diamond hands buy more and more and hold like the fucking bosses they are   Y'all diamonds hands should actually thank the paper hands It's their FOMO that drives the big spikes  You need volume for positive movement and just buying a share or 20 when you have some spare cash isn't how that happens ,2021-03-16 00:34:35.394768

to be fair  I also have an alert for volume  I was watching live as it dropped and I didn't fucking blink  I could care less  i'm gambling with money I can lose and trust my DD  and if I wasn't watching i would have got an alert for price drop and no alert for volume  I would have still checked to see what was going on but that drop had like 3-7 mil volume if I remember correctly which is FUCKING NOTHING,2021-03-16 00:36:11.109159

How'd this one start lol,2021-03-16 00:37:14.087332
I mean if we're being technical we are not the ones forcing their hands it's the brokers  We just happen to have what they need when options get assigned but I agree with you they will do absolutely everything to get out of this  They are obviously not going to profit off this deal so the move now is to mitigate the loss as much as possible  Also it's starting to seem more and more likely that the hedgies will not be able to cover on their own  This means either they get funds from another HF the pass the bag to the brokers and I think even the brokers won't want to touch it and if it gets to the DTCC they HAVE to and they have insurance that goes over that situation so the money will come eventually it's just a question of when I personally don't think anytime soon  This war will ensue for a few months ,2021-03-16 00:37:14.087485

Lol  The fact that they're covered calls is better for him than them being naked calls and has very little to do with how fucked he could be though with Gamestop's current downward momentum his calls could land OTM   The point is he's fucked out of his shares if Gamestop doesn't drop to below his strike price    Because then he basically took out a loan to get those shares  If those shares sell below his loan amount he's getting fucked out of money and has to put more money in to make up the difference of his loan    It doesn't matter if he sold covered calls naked calls or poor man's covered calls  He needs gamestop to close below his strike prices on Friday to not lose loan money ,2021-03-16 00:37:37.135640

Don't think you have it right   In your example it would be more like:  100 shares of stock A have been issued by the company  10 shares are held by the board and other company insiders and thus have some restrictions on when they are sold  Thus there are 90 shares on the open market that can be bought and sold by institutional and/or retail investors   In other words institutional investors are part of the float   All of this highlights how manipulated GME stock is: institutions are stating to the SEC that they owned as of 12/30/2020 97 million shares when less than 70 million shares have been issued by the company ,2021-03-16 00:37:45.059683

I agree - what happened on round 1 was the short squeeze   I don’t think there are as many shorts as there were back in January    2nd round was/is some sort of a gamma squeeze and a whale play   Could be whales bought in ramped it to 348 unload then bought puts to ride the way down  Low float low volume can move a stock like that      I still think there should be some run up since earnings are next wk but premiums might have been too prohibitive Friday and today   With underlying price getting wrecked might be ripe for retail to participate since premiums went down a lot     Until Friday/today the charts looked really bullish on almost all time frames   Good thing is today it wanted to touch the 9day ma but it did not ,2021-03-16 00:38:58.335542

The point is to discuss the plays and the analysis       You can live in the fantasy conspiracy world where brokerages are out to get you but if you're ignoring counterpoints and just want to believe your thing despite all common sense to the contrary you can       You made a few points I gave alternate explanations for those things  Short positions buy calls to hedge       If you don't wish to believe that you don't have to but it's a reality ,2021-03-16 00:42:26.587168
Referring to the statements made by various sources in the financial community back during the tail end of the first run up  Always questioned them but I know I don’t know a lot so while I distrust them I know that they know more than I do  I agree it seems unlikely but the numbers being published fight to say they did  Who knows    They’re unimportant if an external factor was to propel us back into the 300s such as a good earnings combined with positive volume or a big whale moving things our way  Problem is we don’t know for certain that any of those things are coming  We don’t know if we’ll get more gamma squeezes  These are all risks as every trade has some,2021-03-16 00:42:26.587251

That's because AMC cleared its major bankruptcy threat when it bartered shares for debt back in January  Now it has a straight forward path to walk to get through COVID relatively unscathed  GME on the other hand is still predicated on a completely unknown but optimistic thesis that it can compete with Steam/GoG/PSN/XboxLive etc ,2021-03-16 00:43:17.586856

Eeeeh you'd still need an influx of cash to continue shorting if the debts you've already accrued from shorting were large enough  If i short at $50 and the price goes to $200 my net position is now 4x worse than before and that'll eat into my ability to continue shorting ,2021-03-16 00:45:37.254312
You pay $120 for the 2022 3 5c  You sell a 5 00c expiring this week for $20 premium  If the underlying reaches $5 20 at expiration you will get exercised so you lose your 3 5c which means you buy 100 shares for $350 sell them for $500 and keep the premium  So you profit $170 - $120 the premium you paid for the call  Multiply everything by 5 if you’re doing this on 5 contracts instead of one     But if you don’t end up ITM on the short position you get to sell another weekly on Monday  Best case scenario your break even never gets reached and you keep rolling out and up until you’re ready to take profits on the leaps ,2021-03-16 00:45:37.865831

Hasn't it been a buy for like 2 months?,2021-03-16 00:51:17.173922
I disagree this isn't going to go up more because of fundamentals such as company transformation  RC is first going to have to catch up and make it worth what it's sitting at right now in price first  Fundamentally it's probably a $20 company at the moment so gotta catch it up to the $200 price range first   If GME is going to get to $1000 or more it's because of the apes hype and diamond hands ,2021-03-16 00:51:19.183568

Well the one thing I've noticed in the two months I've been trading is that fundamentals don't really matter much anymore  While I still do my due diligence I also look at factors most normal funds would not  It seems to be those intangibles that will send a stock skyrocketing  I mean just look at AMC  Then you look at a company like LI or NIO that should be trading at twice their current value IMHO   That's why so many people on Wall Street are so pissed off  They had equations that they would use that aren't really valid all the time anymore,2021-03-16 00:51:28.121839

Buy backs aren't a good thing for long term investors when they decide to buy back when the stock goes through a large increase in share price   It will certainly help the float  but you have to question management's use of capital when they could've bought back when it was cheap,2021-03-16 00:52:52.124786
The price listed is per share and options contracts are traded in increments of 100 shares  You are never obligated to exercise an option and the extent of your risk is what you paid up front    There's 2 options at expiration time: your strike price is either higher or lower than market rate  If higher there's no reason to exercise and the option expires worthless  If lower then yes technically you have to exercise and buy the stock   even a profitable in the money option can expire worthless  In practice if you wish to see it through to the end you can just sell the option a few minutes before market close  Another party will scoop it up at negligible cost and extract the profit for you ,2021-03-16 00:52:54.145307

I think it is a momentum play  For the very short term you can make money   I was holding AMC bags from the last spike     I ensured I had a stop loss in place once it got over 14 the second time   Second time it dropped to $3 60 in the day it triggered    Lost 4% from my buy in but I’m happy to be out    I hope it goes up for others but with GME falling I’m afraid AMC will drop prematket     I agree the dilution makes it a $2-3 stock   I’d not be stunned if they diluted today at the plummet    If news breaks like that it will kill it     I was $30k in and it was a poor play at the time chasing it    I’d rather have been in GME as that was the real play in theory,2021-03-16 00:53:04.035742

I think you’re the ignorant one  The volume issue is because people are holding  The hedge funds are battling and are able to drive markets  Retail investors do no have the coordination that HFs have  There is over 100% float the HFs have to buy everyone’s stock multiple times over ,2021-03-16 00:54:05.474989

Very well where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery  My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet  My father would womanize he would drink he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark  Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament  My childhood was typical summers in Rangoon luge lessons  In the spring we'd make meat helmets  When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds pretty standard really  At the age of 12 I received my first scribe  At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles       There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum it's breathtaking I suggest you try it ,2021-03-16 00:59:30.131917

White flight was usually reactionary  In the case of my small town the black neighborhoods were “company towns ” Little better than sharecropping  Industry built the neighborhood so folk could walk to work then the company took rent out of they paycheck   Fast forward 100 years- whites have retreated to the country where it’s nice and black folk are 3 generations later still living there dying of rare cancers children have rare birth defects and everyone has asthma or asbestosis- never having lived or worked in asbestos    GUH  Trying to fix it is a losing battle  The problem is too big   It’s so fucking painful  I’m hoping after beating my head against this problem for at least another few years I’ll have made a dent in it ,2021-03-16 01:00:07.345740

It's possible I usually avoid placing things to dates  Looking at the hourly or daily we've been sticking inside of an ascending megaphone pattern which is where my upper range of 403 comes from  Bottom limit is around 370 which would also break the trend line from 2018 2019 and 2020's corrections  I feel like we have enough momentum right now to hit 400 to 403 before we move to the downside  I honestly like to only commit to a play when it's obvious where it's going and if I can swing it day trade options to capture a slice of the move ,2021-03-16 01:00:33.615135

6 seems a bit low  It bottomed at 5 5 in February  That's not too say it won't go back to it's covid lows but it probably won't  The irrational exuberance will likely carry for a bit  It'll drop to reality again but it won't get near fundamentals until earnings call ,2021-03-16 01:00:58.722771

Making it cheaper right now is just helping GME shareholders drop more money into it to increase our gains in the future  I don't know what their HF's game plan was but that doesn't seem very smart to me    If they had let us hit a higher crescendo last week GME shares would have likely had a much greater fizzle out this week  Now instead it is a cheaper cost of entry and they have very likely enticed a bunch of new apes this week  These are people who wouldn't have bought in with us previously if price had remained higher  As these newly minted apes hit the scene they will hear from the rest of us who have paper-handed ourselves into regrettable losses and learned from it and they will wise up from our shareholder experience  Then we have more apes with diamond hands added to the ranks of GME shareholders  WINNER WINNER  I could be wrong thoughts?,2021-03-16 01:01:36.878262

"It seems like it was ""invented"" multiple times throughout time  Ancient Mesopotamians In \~2000BC Sumarian scribes used blank spaces to denote absences in number columns  The first recorded 0-like symbols is seen in third centaury BC in ancient Babylon as they used a base 60 number system  A similar symbols popped up in 350 AD when the Mayans marked calendars  Originally these symbols were used as placeholders not it's own number  It was only in 7th centaury AD in India where it gained it's importance as a value  By the 9th centaury AD 0 was adopted into the Arabic numeral system in the shape we see now   So yes and no   Fun Fact: 0 as a symbol only entered Europe in the 12th Centaury AD",2021-03-16 01:04:01.180918

"So plenty of folks are willing to sell looking at volume over the last few days that much is obvious    Remember most folks don't get into the stock market to hold a stock indefinitely  until they die of old age     There's also off market and private market trades  When it comes time to ""buy to cover"" they wont have a problem finding shares     Odds are their buy bot will slowly buy them so as to not effect price    Interest rate is usually determined by how hard to borrow the shares are which fidelity is asking 1 5% ",2021-03-16 01:05:28.678521

If today's downward movement was from paper handed retards it would've been more gradual  If it was a whale trying to unwind their GME position they'd want to do it in smaller chunks in order to make as big a profit as possible  A massive amount of selling without regard for the price definitely looks more like a short attack trying to shake out paper hands than anything else   Look back at today's chart  From open to about 11:04am GME traded sideways and by 11:18am it had dropped from appx  $270 to $226 in 14 MINUTES  As volatile as GME is that seems like a pretty clear and concerted effort to push the price down hard and fast and only people that want that are shortie bitches ,2021-03-16 01:07:08.107582

Me personally   I’d sell one exercise one hold the last one  Either way you’re taking profit loading a position and averaging down and by saving the last one you’re still holding your seat at the table  However that’s still contingent on how much you paid for them and what your break even is  You do you but shares is what’s going to pay off more in the long term for GME,2021-03-16 01:08:25.922656

Tanning is a fortunate side affect of this wonder drug but the regulators would never have given approval for a tanning drug  So the company had to choose a proof of concept indication EPP a rare disease where patients are in pain from being in the sun  This arguably gave it the best chance of being accepted by the regulators as there was no other effective alternative treatment  But there’s so much more to this drug than meets the eye  Regarding tanning they will be releasing topicals which contains fragments of the active peptide  This will be available over the counter and will be priced under $100 a bottle easily  These will induce tanning or photoprotection which helps fight the war against melanoma and other skin cancers  The peptide is also known to repair DNA by extension this will largely prevent skin cancer from developing  This is a huge market especially where anti-aging is concerned so the dermocosmetic market will be a target and is currently valued at approx  $15-25 billion annual and rising  But this is only one small aspect of what the company can achieve  The medical applications for this drug are profound  with one example being a trial is set to begin in stroke patients to help improve recovery in the penumbra site of the insult in the brain  Further there is speculation about a 6th indication being neurotrophic-oriented which could be multiple sclerosis or dementia  Either one of these indications if approved will make the company a $100 stock  This is baked up by the addressable markets Clinuvel has spoken about in their recent Strategic Update document available on their website  There is a Clinuvel forum called Sharetease that has lots of research and information  The sad thing about people’s initial reaction is they don’t realise what this company will achieve long term they only think of the tan  But actually this peptide is essentially a miracle drug which acts an immune modulator repairs DNA strengthens the vascular system etc  In recent studies the peptide was shown to reduce amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s while another study showed rats with induced cardiac arrest had a 70% increase in survivability when administer the peptide  The world dosent understand this drug yet but it has the potential to become one of the most well known drugs  Also because it’s a analogue copy of a naturally occuring peptide in the body it doesn’t have side affects like with steroids and other similar drugs ,2021-03-16 01:09:28.969291

GME was on here long before you jumped on    And I didn't think it was impossible at all  I was making rips off the volatility  Unfortunately I got a series of stuff going on in my real life that I didn't pop out of one of my rips so I could sell when it got high  I even told my friend I was buying more at 45 an hour beforehand  I did sell some when it went up over 200 but unfortunately I can't on the rest   And guesstimate what when this crashes again I will buy more and still do rips because it will spike again because of folks like you  Except the peak will be lower again  I'll liquidate on that one and buy in at bottom again but probably nominal shares at that point and let them sit  I think a third pump and dump will happen before the morons catch on or run out of money ,2021-03-16 01:12:43.660060

"Good job getting indignant for no reason whatsoever   Or were you trying to say that you think non-English speakers aren't capable of using a spellcheker?   Because that's the only way your attitude makes any sense    The majority of people who speak English as a second language are better at spelling than native speakers because they actually try and more often use their spellchecker when they're not sure of something    I literally just said ""*That being said spellcheckers don't correct misused idioms so I think it's still worth making such corrections gently since they're a learning opportunity  People can't help not knowing something if they're never informed *""  So since they have access to the same technology as the rest of us and given that I just told you it's better to gently inform people of errors that a spellchecker doesn't catch could you please try to explain exactly what part of any of this is prejudiced against people who speak English as a second language?

I bought into GME shortly before the RH freeze  I didn’t get the worst of it but I did end up down something like 60-70% idk I stopped watching  Bought some more on the way back up to lower my average   Still green after today’s shenanigans   What I’m really saying is you should have doubled down on the dip  I bought in on AMC at 14 50 and lowered my average to 11 50 last week   The real question you have to ask yourself now is: “how much can I afford to lose?”  You want to go for a ride? Cause there’s a good chance you can sell for a decent % profit  I can’t guarantee that this is called betting for a reason   Me I’m holding long  If there’s a rocket or even a rocket test to the stratosphere I want to be on it   I’m also holding a personal belief that stock is worth more or rather WILL BE once restrictions lift especially with the new deals they’ve signed that helps make them more competitive to streaming which people are totally over after lockup for over a year   I believe the repressed socialization aspect of theater going is leading to a huge boom in the theater business so to me it seems like it will have greater value in a few months regardless of other market movements going on right now,2021-03-16 01:15:45.791294

It's nice to see something different than the usual echo chamber bs every day    My opinion though  with how expensive ITM calls are just buy shares  If you buy an ITM call they will hedge what 50 shares? I have not looked but are those calls much cheaper than 50 shares? Just buy what the call would cost in shares and achieve the same thing with less risk    139@85 00 ,2021-03-16 01:16:24.626650

Next FTD data should be available in the next day or two right? If there are multiple days of 1-3 millions shares fail to deliver if last time is any indication should be several days of modest gains followed by giant leap  I would assume any day like today is one where there will be significant FTD 1-3 million  I would imagine they will try and push the reckoning past this Friday as so many on this sub have staked a lot on it if they do next week is going to be bonkers  And we get to check price movement against FTD to prove our thesis and buy more as they push price down  This is easy money ,2021-03-16 01:16:27.971744

It's hard to say how likely the squeeze actually is because it depends on short interest which is never going to be publicly reported accurately on this stock  I personally feel like the short interest is still much higher than reported and a squeeze will happen   There are catalysts that could cause volume which I feel is what we have to wait for  Because people are no longer buying many shares something needs to excite people so they will  Friday is going to be a weird day because of the quadruple witching day and the 23rd is earnings  Best case scenario is we get an announcement of some sort during the earings call ,2021-03-16 01:16:50.568766

Every time that you sell you allow the HFs to reset their timer for when their shorts have to be covered prolonging our battle with them  Our goal isn't to just win by sheer volume pushing up the stock price it's to force the HFs to buy back our shares at whatever price we want something that can only happen if they have to cover their shorts  The more time they get the greater the chance that a they find better ways to manipulate the market and b our brothers cant keep up the fight lose patience and paperhand off  Don't sell ,2021-03-16 01:18:23.172967

As far as I can tell you can't really lose anymore money than you initially put into it though right?  I mean your call is either going to be worthless or worth very little or worth a lot or something in between   But I don't know how you can lose enormous cash this way     I'm a retard though so maybe there's something I'm missing   There was a guy last week who said something about selling a call contract  which meant he either owed the person he sold it to 100 shares or 25000 dollars    but that seems like something besides just buying a call option ,2021-03-16 01:18:34.987134

It's highly unlikely that the strike price of $510 would be met the next week when that option contract expires   I mean just today GME had to be halted due to massive sell-offs Today's bell opened at around $270 and closed at around $220   Good luck for him to reach the target of $510 next week I just don't see it happening   It was a great play for him as a rich man's lottery ticket I mean it isn't technically impossible for the price to reach $510 and getting that option contract ITM before it expires   I am sure the price could eventually reach $510 but I don't think it's going to happen next week ,2021-03-16 01:19:30.343922

"I dunno my feelings on name changes is kinda mixed    Only examples I can come up with is the world of music    When an established band changes their name after several years ""in the business"" so to speak there's a lot of misinformation about the new band  Some people who don't do a bit of research just lump them in with ""another new band "" Still merchandising and branding is always tough on name changes which is why short of a completely different style and sound renaming shouldn't be done       Personally I thought Metallica should have changed band names after the Black album due to not only a drastic style and sound change but a seeming unwillingness to write music for over 20 years that would be even remotely considered ""metal "" My opinion only    Don't get mad!      In BlackBerry's case it might be intriguing to some to see what this company USED to do versus what it does now  The core of BlackBerry is somewhat the same; the phone market USED to be a huge part of what they did but it wasn't ALWAYS their only function    Just like G E  doesn't ""just make lightbulbs and washing machines"" my own early idiotic ideology about what G E  was all about ""back in the day"" many companies realize that having all your eggs in one basket generally tends to see drastic losses on the worst of days        But it depends on the industry    Fuck I'm philosophizing again   ",2021-03-16 01:20:07.314076

Hey I work in the gaming industry and I just don't see gamestop surviving long term       Converting to a streaming/online model is expensive and time consuming and even there the margins aren't great  Paying for CDN bandwidth and storage isn't cheap  Maintaining a steam like launcher isnt easy       Most AAA game shops aren't going to give up 10% to a streaming gamestop we're going to make our own launchers      They may very well eek some workable model and hold on for a few more years but there's no evidence they're worth the 14 billion valuation the stock currently sits at       Just because a bunch of retail folks pumped up a stock to a ridiculous price doesn't change the reality of the retail marker or what places like amazon have done to them    What the hedge funds did to try to short them out of business was a dick move Im not for anything like that  But at the same time this stock price isn't sustainable unless every retail trader never sells and then what exactly where did that get you ,2021-03-16 01:22:07.045032

I know you guys are all excited to shit on Citadel and all  But most likely what they’re doing is loading up on cheap money now before bond prices spike    My guess is that they think that bond markets are going to spike in reaction to the massive amount of money printing we’ve been doing  It makes A TON of sense to grab cheap fixed rate money now if inflation is going to explode    This is the same reason it’s great to own a fixed rate mortgage during periods of high inflation    In the 70s the fed funds rate hit something ridiculous like 15%  If this happens again they stand to make a ton of fucking money  And if not? The percentage rate on the bond is so low it’s a pretty minimal risk ,2021-03-16 01:22:40.193787

If an entity would give you money at an interest rate you believed you could grow faster than why wouldn’t you?  I don’t think this is any sign they’re underwater ,2021-03-16 01:22:48.935262
For example if you buy 10 shares at $250/share you spend $2500 for 10 shares  The next day if the price of those shares increases to $300/share you still have 10 shares it’s just that they’re worth more  The average daily volume over the last 2 weeks is 48 million / day so it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to make an impact on the liquidity of that stock unless you have massive amounts of money   Does day trading and ending the day with the same number of shares count as “holding”? In your own perspective you’ll just have to pay short term tax rates on your gains  If you hold for more than 1 year you’re taxed less  By trading away and rebuying several times a day as you see the price curve go up and down you are not effectively holding for tax purposes ,2021-03-16 01:22:48.935358

It's a simple conclusion  They currently operate in a state with 1 1 dispensaries per 100k people while legal states are over 10 per 100k  In addition to more competition for customers they will face competition *within their store* for the first time    Currently they ONLY sell Trulieve products  What happens when vertical integration is removed and stores are free and encouraged to carry an array of brands? They could realistically lose over 50% of the shelf space within their own stores and that percentage is across all 70+ locations    There's also no reason to expect them to be welcomed with open arms into a legal market by the retail stores they will depend on to help move their 1 **million** sqft of grow space  It's easy to do when you own the majority of stores and sell your product exclusively  It's a lot harder to do in an open market ,2021-03-16 01:26:38.086920

Better for the lender maybe  Bonds are sold in this case by businesses to raise money  But there has to be an incentive for people to buy them  The incentive is the interest paid on the principal or the yield expressed as a percent  Bonds can be resold and the up-front price of the bond can be adjusted to mess with the effective interest rate  Because $4 a year on a $98 bond is a better yield than the same $4 with a $100 ticket price instead  And when the bonds mature or expire you get the original first-sale ticket price back if you're the last one holding the bond and the bond seller didn't go bankrupt    So it's just a little silly that a shittier rating less likely to be paid; increased risk of bankruptcy bond is being sold with a worse yield than other bonds already on the market ,2021-03-16 01:28:21.434532

I'm by no means an expert so someone correct me if I'm wrong but I believe they have 21 days after shorting to make the cover  They're shorting millions more every week so it's almost inconceivable that they cover their positions because of day traders and paperhands but they're literally just praying that the hype dies down the stock value goes down and they can cover at a cheaper price  They are hemorrhaging money at a huge rate currently but they stand to lose much more if we just hold and wait for their timers to run out ,2021-03-16 01:28:58.228812

I agree to some extent  They do need to strengthen their digital age but I feel they need to completely rebrand their stores as well  It is pretty hard to compete online with digital purchases when consoles make it so easy to make purchases  I feel GameStop could easily make store/gaming lounge work on top of strengthening their online presence ,2021-03-16 01:28:59.906939

Buying calls/puts can can only lose what you put it  The difference being that you are very likely  around 75percent to lose it all  With shares in general they may tank but you aren't going to lose anywhere close to all of it  With options if the stock turns against you it's basically gone very quickly and if close to expiration there is basically no chance of recovery unless a massive move by the stock  Conversely if you buy them and then the stock rips you could quickly find yourself up 4-500 percent and even more  Because each contract represents 100 shares so it's highly leveraged   It's alot more complicated than that but you get the idea  If you buy an option just be ready to lose it all cause that's the most likely outcome ,2021-03-16 01:29:18.002174
BB is a good company on paper with a lot of potential  Their EV software has huge potential  But sadly BB got tied heavily into the meme stocks and it messed it up  The price was inflated for quite a while and bounced a lot because of it  It also continues to bounce  I thing it’s not a $11 stock yet but can get there and beyond  I would wait for dips as tech stocks drop they will and try to get shares at under $10  Anything in the $9 range feels too low for BB right now but it will get there again when people move out of tech as they panic over the market ,2021-03-16 01:29:20.510622

The fact that we weren't able to push 300 last Friday makes me worried that the big boys aren't behind us any longer  Retail alone might not have the volume to push unless stimmy checks do which we'll have to see  ITM call options are expensive AF rn so I'm not sure how viable of a play that is for retail  Thoughts?,2021-03-16 01:30:46.608335

I’m sure that would be a good play as well but I believe Altria will do more than just sit on their Cronos investment especially with how lack luster Canadian Weed Cos have been in the US  Think they take the route of buying smaller established brands to have a huge variety similar to what they have with cigarettes currently  Not sure who here is into weed but if they bought into/just bought any big names like Russian Assassin Boys Runtz Cookies etc they fly  Personally I’d like to see them take a stake in CURLF over any others ,2021-03-16 01:30:50.724508

Hi guys new to you but previously owned ape here - been holding since Jan 27 on GME and AMC  Originally started with AMC but I recognized GME as the more legitimate yet risky play  Currently 60% AMC 40% GME   Anyways this recent 180 deg flip by the media from spreading mass FUD about AMC to now saying it’s roaring back is not only suspicious but telling     I am finally green on AMC I’m worried about a crash tomorrow  If it does I may paperhands and use the proceeds on GME    Not a paper hands bitch on GME though don’t worry,2021-03-16 01:33:22.873034

Publicity helps us find lost apes even if it's random meme based publicity it helps  Think how much Citadel and friends have been spending on buying the media  $300k on charity paints us in a better light doesn't it?

In December GME had 100%+ short interest AMC has 20% they can literally cover in less than a day it's not a short squeeze it's a short pump  It's a great short term play by any metric just riding the hype is an easy 50% gain if you got in below $10 but when you compare it's potential to GME you see it's not the same or anywhere close ,2021-03-16 01:34:43.937586

"I got out two thirds during premarket because it was money I can't afford to lose  Now I wish I had exited completely Cramer is the worst omen      The hedgies didn't get me down  The news didn't get me down  But seeing people yolo tens to hundreds of thousands on useless far-OTM 0DTE calls last week sure did  Wednesday a whale bought a mountain of $200 puts  Then a short ladder and simultaneously the MMs assisted the crazy drop automatically because delta recalc those puts meant they needed less shares held to hedge to neutral  All we needed was people to buy $200 calls to cancel those out and end the week at $340  And it didn't happen  Forbes even said as much and ironically I think *that* was the reverse psychology play      I'm holding on to hope with my remaining 10 shares but unless the PRC / Max Pain gets rebalanced I'm bailing out 9 of them at my cost basis if we see further decline  Retail doesn't have the coordination or capital to create momentum at these price levels  And hedge funds are psychos who don't feel emotion so time is on their side  If it moons to infinite I'll settle for just one ticket  If it consolidates at 40 or 100 again I'll buy back in with a lot more knowledge on how to leverage the MMs against the hedgies   We'd need to basically be a crowd sourced hedgefund to play at their level and win but that's illegal as ""market manipulation "" Since we can't do that our only hope is a whale to match all the unbalanced puts with calls and then to make up some upwards volume frontrunning the MMs being forced to rehedge buying shares  Fuck man I don't want a lambo  I just want an implant dentist  ![gif]emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_bad_man",2021-03-16 01:35:18.637812

"Yep! An Oct 18 expiration with a 30 00 strike on a stock that's currently $15/share would gain a ton of value if the stock shot up to $22 a month from today  Of course it depends on the stock too if it was a stock that only moves up pennies a day you won't make a lot but a more volatile stock like AMC or GME would make much more because of what's called ""implied volatility "" The higher the IV the more expensive the calls and the more profit you can make from them  But yeah you could sell the call a month later in your example and make a huge return if the stock was volatile enough like AMC for example  *not financial advice of course*",2021-03-16 01:37:51.502507

So for question 1 yes 92B is a high market cap and gaining 50% in a year putting them at 138B is a large increase but if you account for shifting P/Es due to growth it makes it very doable  It’s not just the legalization itself they need to take action to grow    This directly ties into why I believe this is a better investment than CRON  I believe Altria will do more than just sit on their Cronos investment especially with how lack luster Canadian Weed Cos have been in the US  Think they take the route of buying smaller established brands to have a huge variety similar to what they have with cigarettes currently  Not sure who here is into weed but if they bought into/just bought any big names like Russian Assassin Boys Runtz Cookies etc they fly  Personally I’d like to see them take a stake in CURLF over any others ,2021-03-16 01:38:00.735538

There are people anchoring a date because they can't tolerate having to wait or not knowing when the MOASS happens   It's a security blanket for paperhands   GME is a diamond hands play   Could be never could be 1 month could be a year   Who cares?  GME HAS LONG TERM POTENTIAL   This isn't poker and we are revealing our cards   The HFs have been at this longer more resourced well-versed and better at this game     Basically the HFs have been fucking us sideways in the shadows and kicking dirt in our faces   Now we have power and are telling them exactly how we are going to fuck them   May not be today tomorrow or in a year   But each day they don't cover is each day they bleed $   So hold ,2021-03-16 01:43:19.592301

Your brokerage account on Robinhood or Webull or whatever you use is still a financial account in your name  So when you sell a stock and the funds enter your brokerage account the profit you made off the sale is considered capital gains and the loss you suffered is considered a loss that is tax deductible  The computer does all the calculations for you and in February of 2022 it will release a Form 1099B which will tell you everything you need to know for filing your 2021 taxes with respects to accounting for your stock trading   For your question about helping a HF buy GME stock well if an HF attempts to buy a share of GME and you sell a share of GME they might be the purchaser of your share so yes  But I don’t think Hedge funds are buying any shares of GME right now  The stock price is above $200 and an HF is assuming that it’s way overvalued  An HF would determine that the real value of that stock is closer to $20/share based on pre-spike values and inflation  Hedge funds look for cream of the crop low risk investments and GME is just super volatile right now so I don’t think GME is anywhere on their radar at the moment  If you’re going to invest your money don’t adjust your behavior on anything about hedge funds; rather invest in a company you understand and believe in  For example the company you work for  You know the company pretty well if you work there every day maybe you know when’s a good time to buy/sell and a basis for those decisions ,2021-03-16 01:43:30.945154
It's alright I'm new to this and in over my head too just been reading a lot  But yes it could be either of those things but I would assume out of my ass that the amount of volume circulating through the hedge funds as they cover and short more is greater than what retail is buying on average  Idrk,2021-03-16 01:43:30.945341

"If GME had hit $380 before the expiration date of 3/12 he would have the right to purchase 100 shares of GME at the price of $380 per share but not the obligation to buy them   In that case he would have the choice to ""exercise"" his contract   Exercising in this case means having the right to buy those shares at his strike price of $380   In order to be able to exercise the contract he would need $380 \* 100 shares = $38000 in order to be able to buy them   If he cannot afford to exercise meaning that he doesn't have enough money in order to purchase 100 shares at that face value then he can sell that options contract his rights to purchase these shares at $380 each time 100 shares in the open market   Note:  Each option contract is always for 100 shares   So when you buy 1 options contract you are indeed purchasing the right to buy 100 shares at your desired strike price   You will only have the rights to purchase these shares at your desires strike price IF your contract reaches its strike price BEFORE your chosen expiration date   IF that does not happen then the contract expires worthless you lose the amount of money you used in order to purchase the options contract ",2021-03-16 01:43:46.953626

It’s pretty obvious the hedges are trying to get the weaklings to paper hand  Look at the volume traded that drove the price down  No way that’s retail  If retail buys up as many available shares as they can at every opportunity especially tax returns and stimmies their short sells are going to be even more difficult to cover and they’ll go belly up tripling down on the same tires bet they’ve been hedging against GME for months now   You like the stock?

Twice today  Did our financial market regulator step in? How about our eff’ing federal law enforcement that should be walking these conspirators out in handcuffs?

Ah so that's why the 19th has been hyped so much  Thank you very much for taking the time to respond to my original comment and provide answers  So does that mean hypothetically we may see a big squeeze on Friday? Or will that come into effect close of play on Friday meaning Monday would be the real date we'd care about? Also where does the money come from if it lands on Brokerages? I know 500k per share is a mean but hypothetically there has to be a max price that can be set for the stock as money is finite right?,2021-03-16 01:46:27.936105

People on the internet are not your friends  A friend would say I'm going to sell some at the peak but I like the stock and I'm not greedy so I'll only sell 75%  If people did that there wouldn't be many bag holders  Instead they're telling you to buy while pretending they'll never sell but making it obvious they intend to unload at or before mars  There is no selflessness in this game unless you get suckered into it  Be careful folks if you don't have an exit plan crashing is your plan   I don't know anything about anything but some of these crayons look like kool aide to my untrained eyes,2021-03-16 01:47:53.245812

Yes I created this account 41 days ago  I created this account the day Mark Cuban chatted with us 🦍  When I invested in gme in January it was out of fomo  I saw the price drop and my portfolio turn red for the first time in my life  I was panicking and didn’t understand what was going on But I held  I learned a lot from the Mark Cuban chat and I continued to follow wsb afterwards  I’ve learned everyday and continue to learn everyday about the current situation of GME stocks options shorts etc    I know firsthand how it is easy to panic when you see stock dip and I understand how a lot of new traders can have the same reaction  I’m trying to help other apes understand and educate them the best of my ability because the ONLY WAY WE GO TO THE MOON is if APES STRONG TOGETHER!   So while you continue to criticize all the newbies that joined Reddit and wsb I’ll continue to try to help my fellow apes as much as I can ,2021-03-16 01:49:01.374044

There’s a lot of rich men in suits who actively prey on ignorant apes  And if you god damn dirty apes think Cramer is the worst of the worst enemy #1 you deserve to get fucked just like how you’re wife is getting plowed by her bf  People who bring up the YT video of him explaining how HF short stocks: how many other videos do you have as evidence of what they do? Cramer actually says it out loud  You think the any of them will ever explain exactly how they fucked you?

The options on meme stocks like GME are bonkers due to the vega while this might make sense your delaying the stock purchase by ~2 weeks alternatively you could buy 100 shares at $220 and sell a call option for say $260 pocket the premium and if it ends up being assigned collect your $ since you made profit on the stock and move onto the next one,2021-03-16 01:50:49.953635

I cleared out of AMC today after reversing my trend from down 80% to up 20%   I sunk all into GME   Now sitting at 300 shares at $141 after starting GME at $343 with 30 shares   I have worked very hard to get this right   Now I rest and wait     My exit strategy is sell 50 shares at $800 to clear my investment and then  💎 ✋  through supernova 250 shares   If it goes crazy to $10000/share I will sell 150 shares and keep the other 100 shares through the split which will DEFINITELY happen if it gets that high     I am guessing 10-1 so that GME can raise money for the conversion and become the Amazon of tech and gaming   This is just me     no financial advice   Also I personally like peanut butter on my banana and am fascinated by my wife's boyfriend's girlfriend and kneel before her for wet golden love ,2021-03-16 01:53:32.847797

Anyone else feel like all the talk of 100k+ shares is counterproductive and pushing people out not drawing them in? I remember when people were excited about 1k as a possibility which IMO is possible and maybe even likely  Now we have expectations which are IMO insane people buying far OTM calls 1 week out and basically donating to “the enemy” etc  rather than focusing on holding shares and buying ITM/OTM calls   Worse there are probably many people who would buy in but they see crazy speculation like 100k+ shares and think “wow this is beyond retarded therefore the whole play is retarded ” If they saw people with managed expectations they might have more confidence  I get it the math says infinite gains are possible  Cool but I think at even 5-10% of that price the government and/or oligarchy will do whatever crazy asshole move is necessary to kill it  Maybe even declare everything we have done illegal and try to claw back money  Let’s focus and get GME to 300 500 1000 and then I’m happy to talk huge prices,2021-03-16 01:54:50.154405

Only scenario without a conspiracy that plays out IMO is they have AMC on the back burner for now  AMC had great volume today and GME volume was shit  Giant sell off on GME at 11:30am EST around that time and I think that triggered some AMC panic selling due to the past where they both tanked simultaneously ,2021-03-16 01:55:13.069039

That’s the plan but without stopping retail any large purchase will drive the price back up  So let’s say you inter a short position using your friend Steve’s shares  You sell 1m shares and tank the price 100$ pretty standard practice but this is where retail timeline diverges  The next step would be paper hands ditching the stock and pushing the price farther down where you safely rebuy the sold shares and pocket the arbitrage    But let’s say that Timmy is another friend who really believes in the company your shorting and he’s waiting for a dip to give him an excuse to buy in he buys in when you sells along with many like minded individuals who start bragging about how proud of their investment they are  Well suddenly the stock price is pumping the brakes and your arbitrage is sinking to make matters worse part of your deal with Steve was that you were going to pay him between  5-2% interest on the shares you borrowed per day  Before you can cover your position and break even the price shoots up because DFv tweets a video of fucking your wife  What can you do from here? Pull your pants up and double down  Repeating the process as many times as your allowed to I mean let’s be honest when the music stops your either fucked or your covered   Currently they are fucked but if people start paper handing it will give them an out   This is not financial advice I hope it did make the situation crystal clear  My hands are in fact made of diamond I am not a cat I am an Ape ,2021-03-16 01:58:03.092256

There is no date  People need to stop doing this as it leads to false expectations and fuels fud  There are alot of upcoming catalysts that potentially could trigger it but nothing has a specific date  The second  hearing on the 17th followed by the dtcc rule change on the 19th and GME earnings on the 23rd  If they get margin called they'll have to cover the positions at market price as they won't be allowed to hold these positions if they cant afford to pay them out  MM dtcc and brokerages have TRILLIONS of dollars so yes they have the money to pay it out just depends if and when they get margin called at  500k is possible but improbable  Money is not finite as they just print more and more of it but the currency itself is devalued look up inflation,2021-03-16 02:00:31.336810

Hold the hate brakes brochacho  They raised 2 4B in convertible notes from VC capital and other investors that wished to remain anonymous  Just interesting that they went from a $250mm F round to a 2 4B round the following year  Yeah $600mm was from a line of credit    https://www cnbc com/2021/02/03/why-investors-were-willing-to-write-robinhood-a-3-billion-check-during-the-gamestop-chaos- html  In the same night WSB was banned from reddit discord and robinhood decided to halt buying on GME  The next week they're set up with 10x their prior fnding round  Yes Squoia would have helped them find capital ,2021-03-16 02:02:05.792991

So my rules with GME are pretty straight forward: If CNBC announces its a buy during a run up sell  If Cramer says he likes the stock sell  If Barrons starts promoting GME its a sell  Today all three things happened and I exited my last long option on the 9th  Jokes on you Wall Street ,2021-03-16 02:02:13.074550

Politics gotta keep it under $1 9T cause apparently each stimulus bill must be less than the last because “fiscal responsibility ” And the nature of the budget reconciliation process has limits and the two moderate Dems can blow up the whole thing and the Senate GOP has shifted to full obstruction mode again so normal bipartisan policy is off the table  State and local governments haven’t gotten a bailout yet and they need something to keep people employed  If anything it’ll barely help people who actually need help afloat—and by that I mean keep their mouths just above water and for only a month or two ,2021-03-16 02:03:05.616044

It’s still outperformed the SP500 since it’s IPO  Was over 300$ prior to the regulation talks  Fair value of the stock is roughly 350$  Only reason it’s not and PDD and JD went so high since covid was due to the regulation threats  Earnings were amazing and when this blows over its going back to over 300$ as investors try to find fair value in a sea of overvalued tech stocks  This is my opinion  There is a risk of Chinese government breaking BaBa which is why the stock is trading so far below it’s fair value ,2021-03-16 02:06:16.473842

Quick follow-up then can you submit that kind of multi-pronged approach as a single transaction through your broker or do you have to go through the whole buy/sell process all four times?

Covered calls are different  You could sell a call for this Friday covered since you own 100 shares at 12 5 for $37  You keep the $37 and as long as BB stays under 12 5 you get to keep your shares too  If you are worried about a price rise you can sell $13 call for $27  Again you keep the $27 and as long as BB stays under $13 you keep your shares  Even if it hits the call amount you still get money since they buy those shares from you ,2021-03-16 02:07:52.604197

You could put forward candidates for the board for the shareholders to vote on at the next annual meeting    I imagine I would be just as qualified as any of the gme board members not Cohen though since the majority of corporate board members literally don't do anything but approve M&A replace retiring or terrible CEOs and approve executive pay packages   If enough people signalled intent to vote for new board members and remove some of the existing ones then perhaps they would feel enough heat to act   I think it would be absurd to suggest individual investors can't coordinate nominating board members but institutions and billionaires can takeover boards  Instutions like Morgan Stanley are literally a collection of thousands of individual 'investors' through their 401ks and funds that use a proxy advisor to coordinate strategy and gain economies of scale/specialization    Replacing a board or crony CEO via collective action of individual shareholders doesn't seem like market manipulation to me  But I'm not a lawyer ,2021-03-16 02:08:12.533165

Your not looking at the full picture though  It depends when he sold the calls and bought the shares  If I own 100 shares of a stock trading at $20 00 and sell a $10 the call price should be the intrinsic value $20-$10 plus the premium  If the stock trades sideways until expiration My shares get called away and I’m just left with the premium I earned  If it goes down below $10 the option expires worthless but the value of my shares are also cut in half but since I collected that intrinsic value at the option sale I’m basically in the same position   There’s nothing dangerous about this   it’s dumb but not risky,2021-03-16 02:08:26.012971

Yes but after a point I feel like it doesn't  Like what's 10% of a billion? That'll be a hundred million  If I had exactly one billion dollars in suitcases around my apartment I could blowtorch piss and shit on 10% of them and be perfectly fine with the remainder  Hell I could blowtorch 90% of that and be fine for like five very hedonistic lives    Being worth 10 million and nuking 1 million still feels like the same story  A million is what 8-12 years gross salary for a mid-level engineer? Even 5 million would be enough to take a fresh bachelors graduate to retirement without them lifting a finger ,2021-03-16 02:08:59.434397

How is this DD?,2021-03-16 02:11:37.275532
Here's an example of why this options play might not work:  Let's say you buy a $125 call expiring this Friday because it has a delta of about 0 90  The cost of this contract is a fat $10220  At the same time someone is buying a $125 put also expiring this Friday  This contract costs $718 altogether   In order to hedge gamma and vega of both the call and the put the market maker can just buy a $195 call for $5305  The remaining delta to be hedged is under 15 shares which can be bought for $3252  The market maker gets to keep $2381 from these exchanges which is a much nicer than buying 90 shares on the market   Meanwhile with that $10220 you spent you could have bought 48 shares outright and have something that lasts longer than 4 days ,2021-03-16 02:11:37.861812

They have no intentions of covering    at least they didn't    Their initial plan was to bankrupt the company so the shares wouldn't have to be paid back  They aren't going to cover until they're forced to cover  In the meantime they'll continue to short and make small gains off of PHB's with stop losses ,2021-03-16 02:11:54.704931

How they choose to gamble shouldn't affect you  You're getting too hive minded when you are telling people what to do with their money if not it makes you mad because you have no desired results immediately    Ask yourself what is your plan? What does your research say you should do? Cause this shit can and will go sideways    At this point this is a game of psychology and money with an upside of GME becoming a powerhouse  When you own shares nobody can push you around  You sell when you want to sell  Options on the other hand that's true gambling   Are you calculated and patient? Stocks  Are you impulsive and want to make or lose money fast? Options  See the post from last week  Dude bought 90k worth of options and lost it all ,2021-03-16 02:12:05.996880

Great points  This entire weekend was one big preemptive victory lap in hindsight this should've been a red flag  I don't think I've *ever* seen a Monday opening go well after an entire weekend is spent publicly jerking each other off about the guaranteed money we'll all be making during the week   In general I think the good deed trend is great  It's a nice way of counteracting the absurd media coverage about the situation and I think it's refreshing to see people coming in to money and first thinking to do kind things for others  I think the general perception is WSB/GME is a bunch of school shooters YOLOing their parents bank accounts  I think if people could see that this is more than a feud over a stocks value they'd be far more understanding and perhaps interested in hopping on board   That said yes     all the gorilla money would've probably done more good in the market this morning  It's not like we really need PR I just see it as a once in a lifetime opportunity to show people that hoarding ungodly amounts of wealth is *not* virtuous   Thanks to the hedgehogs of the world income/wealth inequality are on a trajectory to be the death of modern society   TLDR: Good deeds are great but perhaps we should do them from the moon,2021-03-16 02:12:13.212256

True but no where near the increase of GME  When you compaired them AMC is kinda shitty by normal conditions it's a solid hype play but we're not in normal conditions and GME is a raging bull ready to fuck the 🌈🐻 AMC just a bull chilling    My point is there will never be a play like GME ever agian and the constant suggestion that AMC is similar is neglecting the reality GME is primed for a bull run based on their pivot to E-commerce alone with the squeeze being a big fat juicy cherry on top  AMC is literally just opening up to losing less money they haven't changed their business model at all the only real bull thesis for anything above $30 a share is hype and the possibility of a small squeeze doing something beacuse all shorts can easily cover in less than a day and AMC is fully ready to release more shares to cushion their bottom line after losing their ass during the pandemic    If AMC has a plan to change business models and were taking steps to do it that would be another story but they're just returning to the previous status quo with less capacity ,2021-03-16 02:12:17.539411

If you want a forced cover price has to go high enough to liquidate aka Margin Call  Other then that it is a choice cover  But it costs them collateral tied up interest and fines and risk of lawsuits based on FTDs   Also the DTCC rule could all of the sudden force mass coverings to avoid posting collateral  Where as right now they can clean their position report then re-enter the position and be good for another 30 days  If the DTCC can look daily and go “awe fuck your over leveraged post capital or we start selling”   Our brokerages look at our accounts daily to make sure we are not overexposing them to losses  The DTCC should look at institutions daily  This alone lets you know that the system was rigged to favor wealthy   You will find stories all over the place of an average pleb getting margin called and the stock bounced the next day  Imagine if you could sit in a Margin Call for a month and had unlimited access to the most sophisticated financial and leverage tactics  It becomes hard to loose,2021-03-16 02:13:00.719503

Again I ask with what money? Going $100000 in debt doesn't sound great  Then I can spend the rest of my life paying it off  That's just a different person getting rich off my labor  Also thanks for exemplifying why blue collar workers are so looked down upon in this country  Oddly enough it's that attitude that has dissuaded enough people from learning a trade that what I do is getting rarer by the year and makes my labor even more valuable ,2021-03-16 02:14:14.188334

GPRO is looking good right now   They are a healthy company with more cash on hand than debt   They had $357 million in sales last quarter and have more cash on hand then debt   Their stock price and market cap should be much higher   WSB hasn't been talking about it as it is easily overshadowed by the meme titans   This stock held strong today and even went up another 2% in after hour trading   GPRO should easily hit $20 by eow ,2021-03-16 02:14:31.224841

It's called selling to close the contract  Just like the stock these contracts get bought and sold all day long  If you buy to open today you can sell to close at any time but that value will swing harder and faster than the stock  Which is why options are both awesome and risky ,2021-03-16 02:15:26.050819

Here's my tin hat DD     In my humble opinion There's 2 fucking stonks right now  How can that be so confusing   If average Joe missed Gme and doesn't have X $200+ buy in he will will gravitate to AMC because it's cheaper and when GME goes brr the fallout will be AMC most likely raising with it   Apes know that so hedges must know that also   But first GME has to raise if you're an ape   If AMC goes first while GME dips there will be less financial support and I think this is why if I was shorting I would make sure GME stays low while AMC has it's moment and starves out from lack of GME tendies financial support   If people keep their money/Shares 💎🙌 in gme and there's no tendies to cash in that a lot of money not in AMC so that's good for hedges   Now if people take their money from gme and jump to AMC they can tank AMC and they just wrecked both and made wsb lose a lot of money in the correct order ,2021-03-16 02:15:26.150298

"If the hedge funds were not in danger there would be no need for widespread bot FUD  There would be no need for the private message I got this morning telling me to sell my GME and put it into a certain weed stock  There would be no need for news agencies- which are owned by/tied to/receive money from said hedge funds- to post article after article about what a terrible investment GME is  Especially articles that magically reflect a big dip in the price before the dip even occurs  There would be no need for shill bots to look for ticker symbols to hype $ASS $SSR etc  Notice how those bots stopped once people caught on?   ALL of these things are happening and more  Every day  There are dozens of posts about it  Hundreds of reports of it occurring   If the hedge funds were in the clear- if they truly had no reason to worry- then none of this would be happening   If you can interpret subtext even a little bit it's very clear that buy and hodl are the moves here   The only conceivable thing I could think of for why the hedge funds might do the above even if they were totally in the clear would be to profit off of cycles of FOMO and shorting  It's technically possible  However my money is literally on them being in way wayyyy over their heads right about now   Three months from now I think there will be two kinds of posts around WSB and related subs: massive massive gain porn and ""I shoulda held"" stories ",2021-03-16 02:16:40.010815

Yeah probably especially because they’re running low on funds  They suspended the debt ceiling at the end of 2019 before all this popped off  They have to reevaluate whether or not to reinstall the debt ceiling or not  Democrats are calling to remove the debt ceiling permanently which is literally the most brain dead shit I’ve ever heard of  They’ll try and get rid of the filibuster to pull it off but i don’t even think they’ll be able to get every democrat on board  If it’s reinstated that means the federal reserve will have to figure out how to magically remove trillions in debt because they’ll have to be under the 2019 debt ceiling or else the federal reserve will have committed a federal crime  They’ll probs just gradually lower it back down every year but we’ll see  I think Powell is starting to get a little anxious about his past spending sprees ,2021-03-16 02:17:37.415643

Yeah but those premiums are insane and make up for the difference  We don't know his sell price though since he's screen capping the current price  If he sold those calls today that's almost 150k in premium  If he sold them a few days ago? More than that  Cost basis of 163  Seems like he's not super fucked   If GME tanks he still has the premium  But he's now in the hole on his shares  But he also still has the shares to keep selling cc on  Both of ya'll kind of wrong ,2021-03-16 02:18:45.829386

It’s not that negative  People are making assumptions without even watching it    I was expecting way worse but I thought it was pretty factual and very neutral  Almost every person interviewed was rooting for retail investors and they mentioned the connection between RH and Citadel  Some people have made posts saying it looked fishy because people interviewed had all new houses    that’s not true at all 🤣  There were a couple of Reddit users that clearly weren’t in some set up home    People are also bitching because they claim it ended the story on GME’s lowest prices  But that’s also not true  At the end of it it addresses that the price soared again on 3/8 and this story isn’t over    I’m definitely someone who doesn’t trust the media and I question the intentions of shows like this  But I’ve been on this sub for the whole ride and I didn’t think it was that bad  JMHO,2021-03-16 02:20:01.038736

"Maybe I'm blowing things up but I feel like I should address this since you're not the only one with these concerns:  1  I don't really like how everything I say gets overanalyzed  I don't remember exactly when I said that but it's entirely possible I was tired joking or just plain frustrated  At times my actions toe the line of what acceptable when you take hundreds of mod actions a day it's inevitable  Every decision I make ends up with at least one unhappy party  Understandably I get roasted for when I cross the line and that's completely fair  But bringing it up many weeks later is a real bummer and makes me think twice before doing something fun like posting that cat megathread lest it be considered ""a distraction""  This isn't directed at you just people in general  2  The whole team was exhausted from being attacked from both sides  GME cultists / new users who saw WSB as a pumping ground and anything non-WSB as treason and old and ""old"" users who were frustrated with the complete excess of GME content on the sub   Not to mention we had a whole host of other problems like trying to reinvent the mod bots / automod working with admins avoiding media slander defending against people stealing our name / logo and avoiding anything that could remotely be construed as illegal or unethical   In all honesty when GME fell in Jan/Feb I was relieved  We were all running on empty and it was brutal waking up to hundreds or thousands of hate messages every day    Did we do everything right?

Ahh yes but it does if the company is heavily undervalued    Nobody retail investors that is wants to invest in a fucking mortgage company  They want to invest in exciting things like electric cars retail and integrated software ecosystems  Mortgages aren’t sexy  Hedge funds are betting that people loose interest on an IPO after it shoots up   Remember the market isn’t rational anymore  Fundamentals don’t really matter  Well at least until you have 8 straight quarters of better than expected earnings  Only then they can’t ignore it  But until then and since shorts have no expiration date they are going to short the shit out of RKT for the next three quarters thinking it’s going to go down because it’s a boring ass mortgage company ,2021-03-16 02:23:32.965566
Yes he sold calls   If they get exercised he gets the money   In can't actually see his positions because my reddit app won't open the link but let's consider a deep ITM covered call example   Say the stock price is $250   Say that the premium on $200 calls is $80   So he buys 100 shares $25k and sells 1 $200 call he collects $8k   So he is in for a total of $17k   If the options get exercised he loses the shares but he collects the strike $20k   So he is into the position for $17k and he is out for $20k   Net profit = $3000   On the other hand if the stock tanks to $150 then his shares don't get called away but his 100 shares are only worth $15k   So he is down $2000   This is a bullish though heavily hedged position   His max profit happens when the stock stays above the strike  His break-even happens when the stock is at $170   If it goes below $170 he loses money ,2021-03-16 02:23:32.966146

For me it feels great when you like 2x something or beyond  Or have a multiple six figure exit  Then it’s fucking party time  If you got in GME below 100 average I think it’s a real possibility for like interstellar gains    Man now I am thinking I need to put more into GME haha,2021-03-16 02:25:55.563159

IV  Was nearly zero  When I had checked it a few days ago it was like 3% IV which is unheard of  ITM Contracts were selling for $ 01  The SLR suspension lead to big banks buying up trillions in treasuries  If it’s not extended they’ll potentially offload all of it at once because if they do it gradually they’ll be selling it at a cheaper price and losing more money  The people who sold puts will have to cover for when it’s exercised so they’ll either have to liquidate their other assets if they sold naked or they’ll have to sell off their underlying if they’re covered because it’ll be worse less the more it goes down  Gamma squeezes are also possible in the downwards direction  If they sold naked and have to sell off their other assets the indices will tank causing others to sell off their assets which will include a lot of bonds  $10000 worth of puts at the time i had posted this would’ve been 10000 already ITM put contracts  Which is the equivalent of 1000000 20 year treasuries  If you wanted to you could go use a put profit calculator and edit the contract price and put 10000 contracts and see what i mean ,2021-03-16 02:25:57.921617

The people in the derivatives market knew exactly what was happening but nothing was illegal and all the institutions thought they wouldn't be caught holding the bag but it wasn't until a bank in NYC got called on their debt realized they had subprime worthless dogshit in their portfolio and the FED chair got involved at Dubya's request   Real fucking talk that bank stimulus probably prevented great depression 2 electric boogaloo which blows shit because the management for all those banks should've been in prison instead of riding a golden parachute out of their CSuite  &#x200B;  The banks had to show their books everyone realized they were upside down on a shitload of mortgages and two banks dissolved immediately to cover small amounts of the problem  Nothing they did was illegal so no one was punished despite the absolute fucking fallout that crushed the American economy   &#x200B;  Don't expect Melvin to walk away from this the same way but I doubt they'll let it happen without all sorts of shady shit ,2021-03-16 02:26:22.280930

Question for people on fidelity    how do they handle option spreads on the day of expiration?    Robinhood closes out all spreads on positions with any kind of volatility unless both legs are at least 5% ITM  And when they close them out they issue a market buy/sell order which is almost always filled well below/above the mark    they don’t even try a limit order at or near the mark  If you have limit orders to close pending they’ll cancel them    For example the past two Fridays I had TSLA spreads with both legs ITM by more than $20  Both times Robinhood closed them for 1/2 the mark average    both times for almost exactly 40% of the spread value   Not only were all my gains lost by they closed them for less than I opened them even though I opened them when they weren’t yet ITM     My $2 50 spreads were closed for $1 11 and my $5 spreads were closed for $2 31    A week’s worth of gains wiped out plus a 15% loss on the original investment    for ITM spreads one hour before expiration!  I wonder which RH employee got to buy them from me without me having any say in the matter     60% lost in three minutes due to Robinhood’s bullshit    The immediate vertical drop on my chart was eye boggling when I opened it   It looked just like GME did on Wednesday    That was a $10000 mistake I won’t make again  I thought the first time was a fluke but the second time showed it’s deliberate   Fucking theft ,2021-03-16 02:29:25.022764

My dude what? Taxation has all sorts of uses even beyond a source of revenue which you’re right we clearly don’t need  Taxation helps to prevent the overstimulation of the economy  Send checks to every American? That is great  It will go straight to consumption in almost every case  But it is possible you could suddenly have too much money chasing too few goods so how do you fix that? You could raise interest rates and scare the shit out of the market  You could force people to save with forced bonds like during WW2  Or    you could tax people who make over $400000 a year so that middle and lower class Americans don’t feel the burden of both the potential inflation and the taxation that could help stymy it ,2021-03-16 02:30:52.453026

So the next budget reconciliation will happen in October and a bi-partisan infrastructure bill will never see the light of day because of GOP Senate obstructionism  So at least we have a solid timeline for the next fiscal juice  Because of the nature of budget reconciliation the two moderate Dems Manchin and Collins have the BR process by the balls and so we’ve seen the stimulus grand totals wane due to these two Senator’s inane sense of fiscal responsibility  Markets expect that to continue and the next undoubtably infrastructure-centered fiscal policy to reflect that trend   But here’s the catch—what if Manchin and Collins play ball for infrastructure? What if it’s a $2T or much much more package that blows away expectations?   Infrastructure and energy has been ripping during this Biden administration in expectation of infrastructure investment but prices don’t reflect a BR that wildly defies current lowered expectations  And there lies an opportunity ,2021-03-16 02:32:14.263525

They needed to buy back more shares than exist  At 140% shorted they needed to buy almost 100 million shares and as they did the price was going to reach thousands of dollars per share  The market cap would have blown up well past 16b as the shares went skyrocketing   It would have eclipsed the rest of the market however briefly and tanked everything because they *repeatedly* engaged in a strategy of infinite risk  They violated the rules of the free market to avoid detonating the bomb they created from over-shorting ,2021-03-16 02:35:32.912673

The theory is basically that the HFs would bankrupt then the DTCC would use its insurance to foot the bill and the Fed would print the money to back it  Which assumes that people who lie and cheat daily for a living would just HAVE TO pay  It’s all predicated on the US wanting so badly to preserve the purity of its free market that it will just take the world’s biggest L  Obvious to me that the powers that be would rather just cheat say that we are economic terrorists or some BS and most of the finance world will welcome it  Because the alternative is catastrophic for them  Then they can adjust rules to prevent it happening again   We don’t even have close to a free market  Mortgage bailouts QE etc are already huge violations of that “purity” and guess what people still do business in the US ,2021-03-16 02:35:33.520175

The problem with only buying options is that they can just run down the price with shorting   If you buy shares it takes the shares out of the pool forever and even if we miss this gamma squeeze shorts are permanently in a weaker position   Shouldn't the goal just be buy as many shares as possible?  If that's the case then waiting for them to try tank and buying back is the most capital efficient strategy to grab up shares ,2021-03-16 02:36:49.897059

No… Taxation has one legitimate purpose and one purpose alone:  to raise revenue for the few legitimate functions government should be doing   It should not be “managing“ the economy  It makes a mess of everything it touches and it needs to go back in the box it came in   Sending checks to every American is just stupid  It’s the equivalent of plugging a power strip into itself and still coming out with less electricity than if you had left it alone   The situation of inflation you are talking about is made in one place and in one place alone and that is Washington  If you want to keep the value of your money stop all the taxing and all the damn spending  The endless taxation and the mindless spending have almost completely destroyed the value of the dollar ,2021-03-16 02:37:14.908636

In round one I will admit I was in it to make a profit   I did   Then I learned why it happened and to be honest it pissed me off   I like Gamestop and AMC   Always have   For a HF or HFs to target these companies and try to destroy them in order to further line their pockets doesn't work with me   Retail investors have them by the juublies and those HF bastards will do all they can to avoid handing bananas over to the Retail investors   We are beating the HFs at their own game   Its no longer about personal profit   This is about biting out their livers with my teeth and spitting it out at their feet while they watch in horror    and then moving on to their buddies and doing the same thing     Once I learned how HFs make their living and what they intended to do to my beloved childhood friends GME and AMC the gloves are off   I fully intend to ride these shares to the end wherever and whenever that arrives   If they want to do ladder attacks to reduce the price GREAT!  I will do just what I have been doing buy more and more and more    I am no expert but borrowing 600M 45 days or so after coughing up 2 8B for those idiots at Melvin doesn't instill confidence in Citadel's cash flow situation  I don't want to bleed them to death   I want to rip out each major artery one by one until they are so utterly devoid of blood not even one more drop can be squeezed from them with a steamroller   Don't attack my childhood friends!

I could see infinitismals before/after the first/last place value with a digit expressing something larger than zero/nothing yet for digits that the zero is stating there are no numerals in that place a zero makes sense  IE 105 essentially if you were to decompose the number it is the same as saying ten tens and five ones or /one/ hundred /zero/ tens and /five/ ones so the zero is important to note that there is an a sense of a numeral which is not infinite  However prior to 105 you essentially have a zero in the thousands and tenths space assuming all digits not written are zeros  yet here I could see it needing notation of an infinitismal as the absence of numbers extends throughout all place values held throughout the number ♾105 ♾,2021-03-16 02:42:36.408604
The difference they net in that is a potential future loss transferred to another firm / person that then bought that short at a higher price from them  It’s still valid and out there but their short attacks increase the price of them which they pass on to someone else,2021-03-16 02:42:36.408717

You always expected she’d show up and suck ur dick  Well you were nerdy and put ur time into school and that didn’t happen and every day you were disappointed  When the squeeze hits it’ll be as if you just graduated with a super nerdy job that pays and now she globs on ur knob wheneve u like   That’s how the squeeze will feel Like her under deserving mouth on ur over deserving dick  But you’ll be numb from the years of self hate dips and peaks so you won’t enjoy it  Tldr hold,2021-03-16 02:43:00.600087

All this talk about hedge funds attacking when the reality is that there are shit tons of common folks who put some money into it at 150 and got out at 300 because     money  The people who are still hyping it now either got in so early it can go down to 100 and they will still have a a 10 bagger or the idiots who bought after it had been blowing up 5 days already and now have no choice but to hold and try to get as many others to hold as well so they dont lose the farm ,2021-03-16 02:43:58.887078

Now I haven’t understood this but why help your children with college? I’m 24 and while I am fortunate to get some cash from the VA I’ve taken out loans to cover necessities and what have you  My mom lets me stay at home whenever I want to still but during the semesters I’m living on campus it’s also an hour away from home    I know I have some fortunate things like a mother who supports me mentally and emotionally and really pushes for me to make financially sound decisions some people don’t have that  I get that  I understand helping your child with miscellaneous things like paying for laundry detergent or some snacks here and there but paying tuition and everything just seems ludicrous to me  Paying for my own shit really made me start making financially sound decisions  Sure I was taught it but I really understood it when I did it myself  Just wanted to rant a bit about some dumb shit,2021-03-16 02:44:28.070744

Well good news is that it ain’t going to 0 anytime soon  Bad news is that this stock is NOT trading on fundamentals  RC is here to make money  If he isn’t hedging his $8 per share that literally went up 1700% less than a year he isn’t as smart  as I think he is lol,2021-03-16 02:45:45.250923
I haven’t made the transition to full tard yet so I’m probably not the best person to ask - but this news honestly doesn’t change my personal strategy  While I do hold shares I am not buying anymore at these prices  I do like the stock and have sold and continue to sell cash secured puts  If the price drops far enough not only am I buying more but other people will have paid me to buy more  If it moons before I can buy more well I still have my original shares and I’m ok with that  It’s all about your level of risk to value  No other ape can decide that for you ,2021-03-16 02:45:45.251032

I am going to be buried with my GME shares as stuffing for my coffin and pillow  They ain’t getting my shares back!,2021-03-16 02:49:30.133364

That’s not a bad average  I think this squeeze is not ending soon  You should do really well as long as you don’t get too greedy  Somebody is going to be left holding the bag someone has to  I should have been more disciplined with GME but I’m up which is OK with me when I’m trading with crazy people 😆,2021-03-16 02:49:38.436207

I own 120 $GME @ $212  On Monday each week I sell a slightly OTM call for that Friday  Example: Sold 3/19 250C for $6655  I keep the $6655 no matter what  Best case call expires and I do it again next week  Worst case it gets exercised and I make the premium + ~$4K on the stock and then I just buy more shares and start again    And if it starts squeezing during the week I buy back my option at an inflated price of course and hope it keeps going to cover my premium difference plus lots more  That happened last week except the keep going part  I bought to close my 3/12 225C as $GME was hitting $330 and then it turned around and sunk  I lost about $6K btwn my sold 225C and bought 225C but then I just sold the 250C after the price rose and broke roughly even overall ,2021-03-16 02:50:15.421809

It sure would suck if CNBC's parent company ended up losing millions from short sellers after this!

The amount of autism in WSB to me says the majority of members are underage and wont be getting it i like your enthusiasm but i doubt its that high   Also telling everyone to buy certain stocks would be market manipulation which is bad  so be sure to advise that it is not financial advise and that you merely like the stocks ,2021-03-16 02:52:02.896185

Gamestop needs to max out by March 22nd      Earnings report is March 23rd at which point the SEC allows them to issue shares and sell them   At @ $200+ a share they'd be crazy not to grab cash for the future of the company   That would hurt our position    I like the stock but I won't be in it by the end of March 22nd    March 24th probably but that day and a half not likely   Make it moon before then apes ,2021-03-16 02:52:04.482422

A catalyst comes causing mass buy in on a stock that is using synthetic shares to cover all buys currently?

We like wildlife and decided to spend some gains on it  That wasn't excessive  That's people being kind  You wouldn't tell someone loving in a million dollar house that their valuation of the house is excessive  Well we're holding a high valued stock and the DD heavily backs it  Citadel owes back the stocks  We have the stocks  Therfore in order to get them they have to pay us  The Finra report still says the shorts are there so why would we have reason to think it won't happen? There are three possibilities here  1  Citadel pays interest on the borrowed stocks until they go bankrupt considering they just lent out 600million I O U'sBonds it's pretty clear they are running out  2  The squeeze happens and we get our tendies  3  The squeeze begins to happen and fuckery happens again   Nothing about what we're doing is excessive ,2021-03-16 02:52:43.475113

I bought this morning when they were a penny for a contract so each contract was a dollar  The contract I’m holding now closed at $ 07 when it was up to $ 11  I think it’ll go up still this week but like most trades at lot comes down to FOMC  We’re past the $92 strike so the only barrier we have left is the $95 strike which is what i bought  There wasn’t much open interest tho so it might not be institutions selling those contracts which is good news  I suspected that when there was no hedging at $92  We just easily slid right past it ,2021-03-16 02:53:04.210790

1  You say “regardless of how large the float is Nokia’s market cap right now is ~24B” but that’s how the market cap is calculated  You can’t disregard half of the calculation for market cap  2  Comparing GME price and market cap to NOK is not a great fact to use for your DD,2021-03-16 02:56:45.452207

"I appreciate your enthusiasm but want to provide a competing perspective  On the conference call AMCs CEO shared that LA theaters disproportionally represent a large source of their revenue  While other reopenings will potentially create enthusiasm there is an old adage ""buy the rumor sell the news""  Everyone knows they are opening back up it doesn't take any special critical thinking skills to piece that together  AMC in my opinion is not some symbolic bastion of American lifestyle and representative of something more meaningful  It's a company that is in dire need of new revenue streams and has to find a way to adapt and take advantage of the spotlight  Announce a partnership with GME to host gaming tournaments partner with the NFL to have theaters dedicated to games on Monday/Sunday stir up partnership interest from streaming platforms  They need to take advantage of the virality and continue to create ""rumors"" ",2021-03-16 02:58:49.015201

"Basically what he did was he paid a certain premium in order to secure his right to purchase a total of 61 options ""calls"" contract PROVIDED that his strike price was met before its expiration date   IF his strike price wasn't met hint: it obviously wasn't met before the expiration date then the option contract expires worthless   He did not purchase all of these 61 options contracts at once he purchased them with varying strike prices but with the same expiration date of March 12 with the only exception of the last option contract that the purchased with an expiration date of March 19 and a super far-reaching strike price of $510 dollars   Now let me explain in great deals what all that means   A strike price is basically a price where you THINK a stock might reach before your chosen options contract expiration date reaches   Let's use the first options contract that appears on that list as an example: the one that expired on March 12 with a strike price of $360  -  note: don't forget the part that says ""20 buys underneath that options contract it's also very important here   Also before I continue explaining this I need to let you know how many shares would you buy when you buy 1 ONE option contract:  Each option contract gives you the right but not the obligation to purchase 100 shares at your chosen strike price so when you see an options contract valued at $0 01 in reality you would need to pay $0 01 \* 100 in order to buy that options contract the total invested price would be $1 to secure just ONE options contracts   This buyer bought 20 contract calls which mean he paid $20 to secure his right to purchase 100 \* 20 = 2000 GME stocks at a price of $360 with an expiration date of March 12   IF by March 12 the GME stock didn't reach $360 and it didn't then that options contract expires worthless he losses the $20   The other options contract that appears on that list in the order that appears on his screenshot:  2:  He bought 10 options contracts calls with a strike price of: $380 with an expiration date of March 12 with an options price of $0 01 per share   Since we already know that 1 option contract represents the right but not an obligation to purchase 100 shares at your chosen strike price then buying one option contract at a price of $0 01 carries an investment price of $1 a penny times 100 shares basically   He bought 10 options contract calls which means that he invested $10 on that one   3:  10 contracts of GME $275 call with an expiration date of March 12 at a price of $0 01 per share: He paid $0 16 \* 100 shares = $16 00 \* 10 contract = $160 invested on this one   4:   10 contracts of GME $285 call with an expiration date of March 12 at a price of $0 03 per share: He paid $0 03 \* 100 shares = $3 00 = 10 contract = $30 00 invested on this one   5:   10 contracts of GME $330 call with an expiration date of March 12 at a price of $0 01 per share: He paid $0 01 \* 100 shares = $0 01 = 10 contract = $10 00 invested on this one   6:  And finally this one is the ONLY one that has not expired yet but it has a very ridiculous strike price chosen of $510 with an expiration date of March 19   UNLESS GME is valued at $510/share on or BEFORE March 19 that option contract will too expire worthlessly:  1 contracts of GME $510 call with an expiration date of March 19 at a price of $10 58 YIKES!! - thankfully he only bought just 1 contract instead of 10 contracts like he was doing for all the other contracts: He paid $10 58 \* 100 shares = $1058 00 to secure his rights to purchase 100 GME shares at a price of $510 per share IF the price of GME makes it to $510 on or before March 19 2021   If this is NOT the case then he would lose his $1058 that he paid in order to secure this contract   Total amount that he invested on all these 6 covering a total of 61 options contracts: 20 + 10 + 160 + 30 + 10+ 1058 = TOTAL he paid out of his pocket:  $1288 which coincides to what we all see on the top of that screenshot: Contracts: $61 Value: $1288 00  Out of all that $1288 he has so far lost: $230 on every options contract that expired on March 12 worthless   The only option contract he has NOT lost YET is the last one that he paid $1058 with a strike price of $510 and it would NOT take a rocket scientist to assume that he would be losing that one too when March 19 comes and the price of GME hasn't reached at least $510 or greater by that date   He will ONLY win if the price of GME reaches $510 or greater BEFORE march 19 very highly unlikely basically he just played the rich man's lottery   I decided to explain my answer in great detail taking advantage of this to also explain or at least give an idea of house options work at least it's very basics   This answer only covers examples dealing with calls you win if the price goes up and matches or exceeds your chosen strike price this answer doesn't cover Puts which is roughly the opposite of a call   In a very short brief:  Buying a put option allows an investor to benefit from a drop in the price of the underlying asset while also limiting how much loss they may sustain if the price rises   So basically if you are in favor of a stock price appreciating in value you think that a stock price is going to go up in value not down you want to buy a call option contract not a put   Of course the safest approach would be to actually buy the stock directly instead of an options contract and option contract has a finite life span you are limited to the expiration date you chose and you risk your capital if the stock fails to appreciate to your predicted price before the expiration date reaches   Options can be great and an occasional play to a market condition that you are almost certain is going to go in the direction you see it going but it shouldn't be your main investment driving force -- unless you know what you are doing and have a great strategy that is working   If you are getting into options it would be a great idea to toy with a very small percentage of your overall account balance you do not want to go all-in on an options contract - its a huge gamble that can either pay off really REALLY good eg: you hit the jackpot on the rich man's lottery or you could wipe out your entire account balance ",2021-03-16 02:59:27.784053

So    From what I understand about operational shorting after doing a lot of retardsearch is a short position in an operational short *really* gets fucked if there's 5-6 days worth of buy volume in a single day   There was an interesting talk about it from UVA and they used ironically enough XRT as the example  So it's entirely possible that this event has been the test case that wasn't really meant to be tested   Can that much buy volume happen?

"> We still must remain apes    I think we should all just do what's best for ourselves  Be united as a group with a goal but be individualistic when it comes to how we enact that goal  What good is a totally stressed out potentially deep in the red ape? We want apes to be strong and being strong means being fearless and being fearless means different things to everyone    > The reverse narrative is taking hold and ruined the buy the deep dip dialogs  No punishment for any hands diamond of paper  I think that ""reverse narrative"" tends to be anything that goes against ""GME 100k!"" which lets be honest apes whats best for the pack is each ape getting theirs  Let them be the decider of what that is for them  Some did not want to buy the dip and it proved to be a successful strategy as there were only two short windows where buying GME would've ended in net gains today  Volume was on the lower end and call option volume was abysmal    I think the brutish nature of the BTD mindset with Apegang was hilarious at first but now it borders on what you'd expect from the intellectually disadvantaged  And its a shame to see so many apes be cast out from a group they dedicated their life savings to simply because they have a *slightly* different opinion and made the mistake of sharing it with a group they thought were their peers    But thats just me big dumbo ape ",2021-03-16 03:04:06.610182

Was talking to a local GameStop employee and asked if they had a stock fund and it doesn’t sound like they do    Someone Ryan Cohen on the inside needs to have their 401k provider offer a GameStop Stock Fund so that GameStop Employees can   participate in their retirement    97% GME/3% cash  Lots of employers do it ,2021-03-16 03:04:31.137923

Imagine this this isn’t real just imagine - GME & AMC announce a partnership       AMC to host GME sponsored gaming tournaments for all of us to watch in theatre  Every god damn ape on earth would pack the theatres  They can pull thru and turn this crap around  We can save america    * “Remember this  The people you're trying to step on we're everyone you depend on  We're the people who do your laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner  We make your bed  We guard you while you're asleep  We drive the ambulances  We direct your call  We are cooks and taxi drivers and we know everything about you  We process your insurance claims and credit card charges  We control every part of your life   We are the middle children of history raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars and rock stars but we won't  And we're just learning this fact   Do not fuck with us ” *,2021-03-16 03:04:56.984819

It's risky but with the potential for 200%+ returns and that sweet dividend money I'm probably going to dump all my AMC proceeds into it once the hype wears off   It's also good from a portfolio side too as it not only adds a new sector but a new currency to the protfolio too to hedge against falling currency values ,2021-03-16 03:05:00.278089
