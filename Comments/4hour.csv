Limit sell: I’ve read that it’s good practice to have a limit sell set it and forget it  If I set a price of $100 for a share that’s trading at $10 and the shares are shorted by HF is there any scenario that my sell limit will be executed even if the price per share is trading at below my target price?   The reason I’m asking is because I see a lot of posts saying set your limit “very” high  Is this because the HF could “borrow” my shares for their advantage? Thanks ,2021-03-16 16:23:18.053142

"The concept of 'Averaging Down' or that future transactions somehow change past decisions      It's something advisors and reps have frequently pushed on people because it works well with human psychology of chasing losses and loss aversion       If someone buys something at $100 and it drops to $50 then you can convince them 'Just buy the same amount and your average is now $66 66'      That appeals to people because it makes things look less bad you didn't lose 50% you only lost like 20% it's all good  They kind of use it to erase the bigger past error       The flip side is people don't tend to 'Average up' they keep it individual in their mind       I noticed over a long time when someone is down they tell you their average cost     When they're up they tell you the different prices ""I got in at $40 then i bought more at $90"" They're proud of their lowest trade so they keep it mentally separate each decision is good so they don't merge them       It's all psychological but the end result is it makes people more likely to double down on bad bets but not add to good bets which is in the long run a bad strategy       I've spent a lot of time in Poker rooms too and you can really tell the difference between the people winning and losing 'cause the winners remember and account for every dollar the losers like to 'forget' they bought in 4 times not 2 ",2021-03-16 16:24:38.138658
I disagree with the sentiment of people are always gonna say hold no matter what  But the people who were more realistic who got in early and sold after seeing the huge increases without greedily holding out for more made way more money than the day traders  First time round I held for too long due to greed  I was lucky that I got in early enough and still made a fairly big profit but it was a lot less than it should've been  This time round I did a bit of day trading while keeping the number of shares I was holding consistent at the end of the day  I made much more money from just holding medium term than from the day trading  It's possible to make money day trading but it's inherently risky  It's not some genius new idea to day trade on volatile stocks people have been doing it forever you don't need a stock like GME to be able to day trade  But your ROI when day trading is always gonna be modest in the long term at best especially compared to the potential gains you can make from investing in and holding a big winner ,2021-03-16 16:24:38.138848

Exactly we got the upper hand as we're can react to what they do next  If they dump it we can buy in  If it starts to rise we won't have missed on too much gains  For example if it closes 200 then opens 215 tomorrow  Its only a 15 difference to our purchase  If it opens tomorrow at 185 it's also a 15 difference  The end will be we have 2/3 more shares or 2/3 less shares which is major ,2021-03-16 16:25:50.964734

"I listen to the logic of Bruce on youtube   he is a trader from years ago but he is really up to date with today's market as well   He was explaining this a m  about how HF can disperse various accounts with brokers all over to execute these ""attacks""    they are trying to drive down the price to ""shake out"" shares and scare the paper handed investors   His refuting point was to say that this matters not in the large scheme of how many shares are available   up and down   all around   they still have to find the shorted shares and they are just not there!  so it helps me to relax to know these facts ",2021-03-16 16:26:07.061429

"Can't use the gold standard and compete with a country that doesn't though the maximum value your economy can have is limited by gold or whatever store of value you want to use  Its great for stopping assets from hyperinflating like the stock or housing markets but it's not great for allowing constant growth to allow capitalism to sustain itself  Financial growth is limited by the quantity of non-fiat currency you have it's a double edged sword    You also have to deal with foreign powers influencing your currency via flooding or restricting the market of said store of value and when technology is developed that can ""make"" gold or whatever you use as currency you'll eventually have hyperdeflation as a problem instead of hyperinflation ",2021-03-16 16:26:31.191013

"GME was marked ""hard to borrow"" as recently as last week   And open short positions have increased in all ETFs that contain GME   And there's still < 500k shares of GME available to short   There's no way shorts are covered in any serious volume  You could say maybe all low $ shorts got out and were replaced by high $ shorts but whether you got in at $4 or $400 the delta of each share is still -1! And whether it's to avoid a loss *or* lock in a profit that short position still needs to get closed ",2021-03-16 16:26:47.207241

Will not trigger until it is a little above your limit sell price   That being said forget limit sells   The reason people are saying to set GME to an ultra high figure is to eliminate the possibility of sell walls being formed   Generally people tend to pick even numbers and those limit sells will group together  Then when the stock hits that price and triggers all the sales the price will tend to drop immediately after ,2021-03-16 16:26:50.129264

I really don't know why people think he will raise rates when everyone else in the world is doing negative rates    Even the theory of inflation doesn't make sense  For the past decade the FED has failed at hitting inflation targets despite actively trying yet people think congress can succeed where they failed in one year?

I have a business degree and a computer science degree  I was originally finance but i didn’t agree with what they were teaching us so i changed to business with a focus in marketing  A lot of marketing focuses around human psychology and buying behavior which helps  But honestly most of what I’ve learned is just from research  Download Firefox on a desktop and get a paywall blocker extension  The juicy info is behind those paywalls  They’re not gonna give the good stuff out for free  Ask yourself questions while you read and the Google those questions  Then ask questions about those answers  Eventually you go down a rabbit hole and learn a lot  A good place to start is learning about the federal reserve and impacts of their policies on a macroeconomic scale learning about greeks with options which is the main reason 80% lose money on options learn about the VIX learn about stock market history and learn about dark pools ,2021-03-16 16:27:31.122633

I don’t think there’s anything to debunk  If you buy ITM call options then the sellers are forced to buy 100 shares to cover their calls  And as the price goes up the higher strike purchased calls will be ITM and those will need to be covered    Problem is that IV is so damn high that very few of us can afford them   But we can keep holding our shares either HF spend money to keep IV up or IV drops more people will be able to afford ITM calls ,2021-03-16 16:29:00.980337

I’m not talking about just any stock though  GME is special because we know so many people value it higher and holding while volume is so low  But all stocks suffer from the last trade as misrepresentation of value perception extent up or down    Say you bought a Tesla for 100k  Your neighbor bought one too  But the guy doesn’t value it so he sold it to someone on Craigslist for $1k  In this example that’s the last trade  Will you believe your Tesla is worth only $1k because that guy sold his for that amount?

Precisely I really do think that this is the play right now  This week and last were absolutely loaded full of options going up to $800  There is no way that they were purchased by retail we don't have that kind of buying power especially on the options markets    I really do believe that was the shorts trying to stop themselves from going bankrupt during the squeeze and if you were a rival HF who wanted to take out your opposition how could you do it? How about wasting their call premiums and cheap shares if it pops then once the options are gone *then* trigger the squeeze   If the short HF's had bought those call options then the squeeze would have much less potential as there was basically enough shares there to cover most of the squeeze itself and keep it below $800  If I was a really vindictive HF who hated Citadel I'd absolutely cut their lifeline ,2021-03-16 16:29:32.806044

"I disagree here are three reasons:  1  New laws/regulations come out which can speed up or slow down these processes via different methods such as taxation and rebates   2  Companies routinely adjust forecasts 3  The price of these stocks fluctuates  For example in the last 2-4 weeks many companies in the market went down 20% let's say this affected a company such as SunPower  Nothing with their business has changed no new laws or regulations against it have been put in place  The whole market simply went down because the 10-yr bond yield was raising  This was fixed by the government buying these notes but the price of these stocks is still down  The still have the same outlook if not better is their future value still ""priced in"" even though they 20% lower than their high?  I am not arguing what is the correct or incorrect price per share of any of these stocks my only argument is that saying that a stock is ""priced in"" is dumb  You could say that about ANY stock at any time  You wouldn't be wrong necessarily but it just doesn't add anything to the conversation ",2021-03-16 16:30:38.621033

There is no cap to how much *can* be made off of this  That is how the squeeze works  They have to pay what the market demands  If we choose to limit ourselves to $1000 a share by selling it to them at that price then that is the limit  If we collectively say “fuck you pay me” and refuse to sell anything below $1000000 per share they have to pay 1 MM /share in order to cover their shorts ,2021-03-16 16:34:06.768912

The possible gains from short selling are capped 200$-0 means a 200$ profit   but the losses aren't capped  They know this they're not in the business of throwing good money after bad  Aka doubling down on their losses  I imagine some firms are making money playing off all this volatility but my fear is that the only ones hurt in the end will be retail investors left holding the bag    Hedge funds understand how to trade and make money with near neutral positions ,2021-03-16 16:34:15.137324

I lost too much money on them and just gave up  Lol  This was before I knew what diamond hands was  I tried averaging down that’s why I had so much  My initial buy in was around $4 with like 250 shares  One day it kept falling and I kept buying and ended up around 3 15 average with 1000 shares  Ended up selling them for a loss and investing elsewhere and made my money back but clearly I would have been way better off holding them,2021-03-16 16:34:19.166643

They short on the way down  They buy at the bottom  They sell at the top  They short on the way down  Obviously some are losers but those aren't the big dogs  The big dogs are always winning   The difference between an ape and a retard is that retard know hedge funds LIKE what is happening to GME and are making a killing while apes hollar about beating hedge funds when it's like one fund out of tens that are losing  One random fund loses 600mil another 5 make 600mil ,2021-03-16 16:34:19.882373

Ok everyone here's what I think has/is happening   Long HF's wrote loads of calls up to $800 this week and last week  Short HF's fell into the trap of purchasing them thinking this would allow them to cover their shorts cheaply when the squeeze happens   Long HF's then force the price low to force the options OTM  The longs have now effectively taken the money from the shorts via the option sales   Long HF's then wait for a good news item such as positive earnings reports before dumping all of that money back into the stock driving the price up and up and up and up forcing the shorts to cover   This move is vindictive as fuck but if you're a vindictive HF that wants to liquidate your competition can you think of a better way?,2021-03-16 16:34:53.245273

Maybe  There are three kinds of people investing in gme    The people who are long and think Cohen could improve it's 20-40 with online sales and some changes in store  To these people an earnings report and plans are wanted but they should also believe the price as it is now is not connected to fundamentals   There's people who see the multiple firms shorting and the other firms trying to take their lunch and put their money on the longs to create squeezes   Then there are people who heard some very simplistic dd back in Jan/Feb about them shorting more than %100 and the Shorters will HAVE to buy the shares for whatever price and are convinced that dd still holds    Anything that differs from that worldview is a conspiracy  If you write that it's concerning the long whales have stop purchasing calls suddenly you are a shill  It is a giant echo chamber and very annoying to people actually doing dd  I believe the price will increase just not now since the longs need to rebuild their ramp to short ,2021-03-16 16:35:03.959637

LUMN has consolidated nicely in a tight coil around $14 00 the past week   Options vol is as low as it's been in a while and volume looks to be approaching lows as well   Really just waiting to see the move on the 10 year bond and whether when the yield takes aim at 2%   I do think it'll hit $20-22 sometime this year but it's just waiting for the breakout now and tomorrow's JPow conference will probably determine whether it happens in the next few weeks ,2021-03-16 16:36:55.468707

"You can pick ""Snoomojis"" from the bottom left of the commentfield when writing on a sub  Some are wallstreetbets specific like diamond holding ones or so and some are just general  I don't know if it requires you to make that ""snoomoji"" thing to your profile or not   It seems to also be available on the mobile app by just choosing from the emojis  Many of the Snoomojis seem to be animated ",2021-03-16 16:37:54.988386

What if Ken G created another hedge that's fully loaded on call options through offshore enterprises it connects back to him  He lowers price today wants us to buy more  He thereby increase short position in Citadel which he plans to bankrupt  The bond interest gets paid to the new firm  He profits off of selling premiums then when Citadel finally has to cover he knows to go long just before ,2021-03-16 16:38:06.433034

But they're not making money they're losing money  That's not how a Cash Cow works  Their operating income is already negative before you even get to other expenses that's brutal     And yeah the unfortunate part if they're already an online seller they have been for 10+ years  That's   the problem  It's not like 'Hey we'll try this new source of income' they've been doing it it's not working it's only like 15% of the revenue    The really big takeaway too and it's really difficult to get past it is its not like someone else has the marketshare and if they get it they're good   The market share required doesn't exist  Only 17% of games are sold as a physical disc anymore and that just keeps dropping  Even the few staple companies like EA that always liked having that physical presence are starting to find its not worth the revenue split even your casual style FIFA/COD players don't need to see a package to know the next game is out because the ad for it is on their console    Also this whole stock thing maybe white washed their image somehow   but people forget this is a HATED brand  Like Loathed and detested    The consoles don't make a profit but are a necessity   Basically only leaves you peripherals in the long run ,2021-03-16 16:41:23.500243

Well that’s sort of my point   I can’t get my hopes up for information I read here  I trust enough to have bought shares   the evidence of GME over that last few months is obvious enough to have come on board  I’m comfortable holding but there’s a lot of information and dates   I just want to read something concrete  The GME thread is too culty for me to trust also I’m sure you could understand that a bit   you’d have to be brainwashed completely to not see those people are a bit nuts even though they are onto something I think the goal has gotten a bit out of control ,2021-03-16 16:42:15.224161

Since when was WSB about holding and never selling?  WSB was always about coming up with the most retarded plays and making huge bank or of course big losses   GME was a pretty retarded play but it's worked out for many people here   The smart ones are the guys who sold and made bank  I made $500k the last squeeze proof: https://imgur com/a/NUnBE2R    But I would have been up $1 million but decided to diamond hand then only made a smaller profit   Overall I suggest wholeheartedly to anyone who's made bank: SELL and make your money ,2021-03-16 16:45:30.988665

Seriously  While I am also eager for this to stop going below $200 you are 100% correct  Ideal situation for the hedgehogs is if they reframe our view of the stocks worth   I hate to say it but there are definitely people posting diamonds and rockets who are going to bail as soon as they break even because they pooped their pants this morning,2021-03-16 16:46:14.880219
"This is Occupy Wall Street 2 0    When we lost 50% our wealth in 2008 and watched the bank bail out to be ""too big to fail"" we thought ""you are right I am an individual "" Then we learned more about how this has been happening for decades  How corruption and billionaires keep this happening for no gain but money  They fucked the planet fucked the government our taxes go to war and their pockets not to hold up our society  We see infrastructure crumbling every day we drive to work we watched 535227 loved ones die of a disease in a healthcare system designed to bleed us dry  We protested on the streets occupied their backyards we saw moderate change but we had to go back to work  We had to get our tendie crumbs so we can survive this dystopian shit with beautiful sugar coating of memes phones cars and other things to get by    But now we saw they left the door ajar  Their hubris let them make a mistake  But not like before when their friends in the SEC would slap them with a 0 1% fine on 99 9% profit  This was a crack that was found by a prole  And the prole noticed the crack not in a meaningless place but a place that represented us  A place that other proles grew up with  And slowly we climbed in this crack  A share here a share there  We saw the lobby and their riches but they pulled the rug from us  And now the proles aren't going to bellyfeel the blackwhite   In the beginning of COVID we saw what a general strike would do  After decades of telling us to ""save for a rainy day"" --- an increasingly impossible feat thanks to them -- we saw them beg for bailing out after 3 weeks of lockdown  But a general strike is hard  We have to eat we have to work  Work is tied to healthcare after all  And healthcare is the leading indicator of survival   But this  This was easy  We had some spare money  We put it in  ""together ape strong"" is not a stupid callphrase  It is the same phrase that pushes civil rights workers rights progress  With GME we are standing together  Well-off and poor    And now we don't want our share we want the house  The house their corruption built ",2021-03-16 16:46:16.072939

It's trading in a range now between $173 to $210  There is not enough volume at the moment to push the price up  The low volume and price drop is very likely being synthetic shares transferring hands by algos to between institutions    But the average is around $195   I can't give you any financial advice on what to do  But the analysis is fairly strong  If you look at today's post there is a lot of interesting info to base yourself for an entry point  I am predicting that if closes around $201 ideally $212  it might open tomorrow at a higher level and start the advance for the next push up for the next couple of days ,2021-03-16 16:46:43.793562

You’re telling me it was not obvious to you  It was to me      1  Priced IN         2  I completely ignore forecasts because of their volatility and inherent bias  In addition they offer nothing whatsoever on a highly volatile period or from macroeconomic perspective      3  The price of every single equity fluctuates  Why is this even a point of contention???         On a macro scale for long investors absolutely everything you mentioned is priced in      On a micro level price fluctuations server the swingers & day traders with TA analysis on current price trend - in which case the article’s projection is unimportant       It’s not a play I care for short term I’d consider It as long where again: priced in            If you’re trying to tell me that article is a sufficient catalyst for short play I disagree - but you do you and you might be right in the end ,2021-03-16 16:47:06.413934

"That one single comment doesn't even back up what you originally said   That people were burning their ""savings"" for the sole purpose sticking it to the hedge funds   That comment doesn't suggest that ""$500"" was their life savings    And 1 comment out of over 190 isn't exactly a great ratio to support the first point of your whole argument     Go look at any front-page DD about GME over the last three months and find one that doesn't include the price of GME going up in the future   I'd bet that every single one of them do    I don't get why you won't concede that your point #1 is wrong   The vast vast majority of people here bought GME either thinking it would go up or because they thought it was a lottery ticket that could hit big   ""Sticking it to the Hedge funds as revenge for 2008"" was never the motive but a side perk   Maybe a person here or there threw a little money in for that reason but nothing suggests that a significant portion of this forum was liquidating their savings for 0% gains and 100% 2008 crash revenge ",2021-03-16 16:47:09.953905

 PUTS ON L BRANDS LB  L Brands owner of Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body works has been on a meteoric rise hyped by investment analysts  It's in a classic bubble  Today the stock rose nearly 10% because the board revised earning projects and initiated a stock buyback  Not sure what factors have led this company to believe its earnings will be that good when its business has been hugely impacted by the pandemic   Stock is sitting at 61 last time it went above 60 was in 2017 and it dropped like a ROCK after that  At its core the Victoria Secret brand is a losing business  It's based in shopping malls which are closing left and right and are on a tremendous decline  Its products are not unique there are many other brands and stores selling same cheaply made underwear  The stock has had an average PE of about 12 right now its at 18  Retail industry is in a very tough spot L Brands does not have a strong e-commerce presence ,2021-03-16 16:49:42.746212

   I know when this will fly  the exact date it will fly  So do you if you think about it  The shorts are completely fucked  Their sneaky tricks have made it appear that there is a drop in short interest but [this article]https://tradesmithdaily com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/ explains that may well not be true The point is that they prob wld have got away with it on a share that doesn't have the potential of GME but fortunately for us GME is going to be mega-mega regardless or not of any gamma squeeze etc  It will be mega for many reasons yada yada  GME price will rise steadily right up to the point when it goes ballistic  The date in question?  U work it out ape  Clue It'll be when the company next speaks,2021-03-16 16:51:35.502744

If you want to short an index use the inverse tickers like SPXS SQQQ etc    The VXX play is a bit more complicated than stonks go up and stinks go down  If you can time panic in the markets correctly usually during a mass sell-off you can make some good returns on it  Again VXX decays so it's not a long term hold ,2021-03-16 16:51:37.597886

I think you have great points that most people with a wrinkle or two have considered but the fact that you're choosing to post this the first day we see real volatility return to GME after a number of days of smoother incline/declines with a dramatic dip around lunch time and before we see how the new SEC rules affect short interest makes me think twice about the timing    You day trade more than the going advice for playing GME and that's all fine and dandy but I feel like you're just entirely ignoring misreporting aspect of short positions and failure to delivers and again the new rules coming into affect on the 19th  THOSE are the fundementals if the short squeeze ,2021-03-16 16:52:30.548957

Awhile back a lot of us were talking about how the C-Suite calling an 'emergency' shareholder meeting would trigger the settling of shares in order to facilitate a vote by legitimate shareholders   Could this idea still theoretically trigger the MOASS regardless of other likely more realistic catalysts that we have ahead of us?

They would view it as rude  source: all my friends work in one  I for one wouldve said the same thing like im talking here wtf in your right mind would you think it would be smart to run up and take my fucking order at this very fucking minute when I am about to go on a rant    However from the employee standpoint shitty servers do that they rush you in and rush you out  I for one hate that fucking shit if i am going somewhere and dropping money to eat not at no apple bees etc then yes I would prefer to eat at my own pace as well as socialize with my friends not hi how are you heres your food your bill and the door  Shits fucking rude  But majority of servers see it like that the more tables you clear the more you can refill  So using their logic since they are are shitty they figure x tables = x tips so ergo more x tables = more x tips sorta the whole quantity over quality thing    Go to an expensive restaurant where the bill will easily go past 500 a dinner for 6 is about 800 minus tip these guys dont even rush you you can sit for hours and even though the server may do about 2 tables that night that is more than enough for them  2 tables = less so quality over quantity ,2021-03-16 16:54:51.954187

It seriously should become a modernized take on the arcade experience in addition to a gaming retailer  When COVID ends the world will be craving collective social experiences  With all the wild developments in gaming since the hayday of arcades a new take on it could have some wild adaptations I'm thinking of group VR games on headsets out of most people's price range   I don't know anyone who's spent an hour in VR who didn't immediately want to buy one  Its a win win: GameStop makes money introducing the latest and greatest tech to the general public and you can buy it on your way out the door   I definitely agree there needs to be a physical footprint  That said digital downloads are simply a better option in every aspect on literally every console I own  At the end of the day the possibilities are endless,2021-03-16 16:59:14.299444

I started writing a DD post saying it wasn't but then realized that yea it is feasible  @ 10k a share the market cap would be over half a trillion which is less than AAPL's  Add another 0 though and make it 100k it'd be 3 5x AAPL's market cap  7 trillion  BUTTTTT the people who insure that we would get our tendies at 100k a share if you sold is the DTCC who could insure it up to 57 trillion if I am not mistaken  Melvin and Citadel combined would only be able to cover around $50 Billion so the DTCC would have to step in  This is where I get confused though because who's money is being posted by the DTCC to insure our shares if they are sold @ 100k hypothetically? Can't figure that part out which to me is vital  If its money the Fed insures then that is taxpayers money so our tax dollars would pay a bailout twice the size of our federal spending from 2019 alone = hurts the little guy  The DTCC alone cannot insure this amount because they only have assets worth 49 billion  So who's 7 trillion is being posted as insurance in this hypothetical?,2021-03-16 16:59:30.059010

GME DD: I start a poll to see how much each individual own GME stocks   500 people participate so far  Guess what I find ??? Around 50000 share of #GME   That’s 1/1000 of float   IF AND ONLY IF this sample is a good sample of population and 500000 people in WSB OWN the same amount people on WSB collectively own the whole float   Nobody can be sure until more people participate   A lot of people tell me that this will help hedge fund😂  My answer is simple hedge funds already knew how much they shorted and how much retail investors own but WE DONT   Nobody give us the real short interest  Not FINRA CNBC or the rest of them      [vote how many GME you have ]https://linkto run/p/BMTK212Y,2021-03-16 17:01:05.151940

I think you have to distinguish between the hype posts and the actual DD there to be fair  It's definitely true that there's some cult like mentality sometimes I've been called a shill a couple times too but if you know how to look through the posts there definitely *is* a difference between the people who are just looking to confirm their bias and insult everything that falls outside of it and the people that post quality information   I agree with your sentiment in general though and as I said I've had my fair share of concerns - Generally though they've all been more or less answered through a multitude of the quality posts   In general I feel like the people who post the quality DD are also not the ones randomly calling you a shill and they're usually more than happy to engage in discussion For example rensole one of the mods over there,2021-03-16 17:02:25.895918

So whenever someone goes short and is successful that success is added to the value of their portfolio   many take that value and go do other plays with it if they see that this one is working out   A week ago GOEV and other SPACs were trash and the market hated tech and evs as well   Currently there has been a sudden revaluation of this stock causing the shorts to have this margin eaten away    I feel that the bulk of shorts are short from 17 or 18 so essentially we are knocking on the door of breaking even and have spent considerably short interest read sold more shares short at this level bringing that average price down     At a certain level their account goes negative and they get a margin call which is fine the money now or we liquidate your portfolio to get that money which means they sell their assets to purchase shares of GOEV    Smaller accounts may have already blown yesterday but I'd you look at the price action of RKT during it's squeeze you basically saw nothing but some junior trader taking someone's portfolio they spent a decade amassing and  robobuying RKT at the ask    I expect this to happen here at price levels of 24 or 25   ,2021-03-16 17:06:03.869254

Hahaha   They were up 20% sure after being down 80% in January    They were NOT up a net gain of 20% they made back 20% of what they had left over after losing 80%   Let's say they start w/ $100 in January and lose $80 by the end   Start Feb with $20 and end with $24 you've made 20%    They're not making money ,2021-03-16 17:08:46.493889

Also an uneducated Engineer    The common notion is that the S&P will go up an average of 7 - 8% per year asset inflation while our money base M2 and consumer prices CPI will go up by 2 or 3% per year  In a healthy economy inflation is a good sign of continued demand and is therefore a sign of positive growth   However from 2008 until now our economy hasn't been expanding in a healthy way due to companies still relying on really low interest rates on loans to barely scrape by zombie companies  You can see this in the Debt to GDP levels  Unfortunately politicians have decided to stick with QE to prevent a recession to happen and now we're stuck in an endless QE cycle  Companies don't do great for a couple of quarters so the Fed does more asset purchasing stonks go up to drive interest rates down  Crappy companies now have access to cheaper debt and continually pull out new lines of credit to pay off older debts zombie companies again  Same crappy companies keep posting lousy earnings so Fed keeps doing asset purchases    It's actually a positive feedback loop but the Fed doesn't want to acknowledge that they need a new strategy in order for the economy to actually grow in a healthy way  Now that 50% of small businesses are completely dead source: Yelp it'll only be a matter of time before larger companies get screwed by failing supply chains and lack of consumers which tends to cause deflation/stagflation,2021-03-16 17:09:01.829598

Sorry didn't see your reply because of the double botting I got  I just held shares because I can never time my options correctly and because I see enough high-pressure options at work already  Will not disclose the number because it would sound braggy and I have a feeling it could be identifying   I bought in jan at 16 5 and sold at 350-400 when it reached  This second time I bought at 45 was about to sell at 37 actually reduced my pos by 10% and sold everything at 330  I also predicted that the price would peak around 350 and desperately tried to warn people to get out roughly 10 min before the crash  My post history will confirm this if you don't mind sifting through my obvious autism ,2021-03-16 17:09:05.178780

Ok I hear your point and understand where you are coming from  But it sounds like you’re assuming if it wasn’t B then it had to been A  Couldn’t the halt create this panic sell whereby “   or a lot of people shorting the stock in massive amount and all at once?” Isn’t that the exact kind of panic several halts would create amongst many GME investors who are very new to investing in general? As I mentioned once I received the alert and was watching the price go down and not recover totally during the several halts I was thinking how Id panic sell at that point too! I was actually shocked how quickly it did recover to from its low point from the half of $172 to as high as $280+   Again I don’t know if I necessarily agree with your point 10 but I now understand it better  A good argument could be made either way your first two bullets  Nonetheless thanks for explaining ,2021-03-16 17:09:41.912298

I would agree with you that *absolutely* stops being broken and panic selling helped exacerbate the plunge  My point wasn't that hedge funds sold without causing any other people to sell -- just that they helped to mitigate any damage to themselves by stoking positive sentiment encouraging people to hold not sell and only buy  That way hedgies were able to sell at better prices  Hope it's more clear now :,2021-03-16 17:13:07.843837

Starbreeze B = The company that owns Payday  For those of you who likes to play games you probably heard of Payday  For those of you who don´t all you need to know is that it is currently ranked 37 amongst the most current players on steam A platform with over 30k games  This is a old game  Payday 2 was released in august 2013  Worth to mention is they recently started updating it again though   So why am I saying it will go to the stars well it´s simple:  &#x200B;  1  It is extremly undervalued atm   Starbreeze B made a horrible walking dead game and after that it´s stock plummeted like we are talking 90%  Company was indebt things where looking rough  Well guess what they are debt free now  They are losing less and less money going by their recent reports  And rumors say they are looking to team up with some other studio for Payday 3   2  Payday 3 hype is gonna be insane   Now if you don´t like the idea of betting on something like a potential game realease you can stop reading now this is not for you  If being a gamer has taught me something it´s that trailers benefit sales insanely well  Honestly better then the actual product  Just to give an example here is the trailer for said game: [https://youtu be/non\_0jlOXew]https://youtu be/non_0jlOXew  This is just an example but it goes to show they know how to make good trailers  On top of that it already has a solid fan base    3  Payday 2 bear  Okay I lied a bit  Let´s say that Payday 3 is in a distant future  Right I still think with the dlc and active players base it should be worth a solid 2sek or roughly 0 3$ a stock  Currently a bit lower    &#x200B;  Honestly if I did not have 1/3 of my portfolio in it already I would invest more    I would do a DD but since it´s a penny stock I think it was against the rules right?,2021-03-16 17:14:00.923236

Honestly I'm awful with hitting shares at the right time and with a lot of my funds in GME I only place the odd few shares here and there  For me my niche is more targetted towards Shell BP Premier Oil Tesla Vauxhall and Volksvagen Which have only just started to make me profits today   Currently you can just look up US/UK companies who are starting to shift into more greener technologies Shell for example has been consistently growing its electric fuel stations for their own electric car network  I think that Biden is environmental himself so in the long term those markets are going to make the greater impact  I have tried to look further into the companies that help in manufacturing and creating components to these fuel stations as these are all going to be worth a fortune in the next 5 to 10 years in the long term   Just a quick footnote a lot more car manufacturers are promising to go fully electric soon this is mainly down to governmental pressure to switch over  Here in the UK they want to make every new car sold Electric by 2030  By this current standing point its best to be ahead of the times and long term consistent rise will be upon us   //But what do I know all I do is eat bananas roll in hay and laugh when Gamestop is so investable it takes 10 days to get Last Of Us 2 sent here but at least I saved myself $7 including conversion and delivery ,2021-03-16 17:16:44.834859

I understand there isn't much short interest REPORTED  The obvious sentiment stands out though that when you take a few hundred thousand dollar fine every now and again for misreporting or ARE LIQUIDATED OUT OF EXISTANCE FOR ACCURATELY REPORTING the choice is a no brainer  Considering how much media manipulation we've seen I am amazed people draw the line at believing misreporting    Looks like it isn't an SEC rule but a NSCC rule coming into effect  Apologies I'm still learning a lot here   https://www reddit com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5v5r4/nscc_rules_dd_the_vicious_cycle_of_margin_and_sld/  This guy decries hedge funds manipulating us to make a buck but I can't help and ponder the timing of the discord he's sowing ,2021-03-16 17:16:47.087490

For what it's worth I never looked at AMC as a meme stock  Pre-pandemic I wasn't sure what the future of movie theaters was  But after the last year people want to go out and do things in person  People want to go to the movies again    You've had some real flops on the direct to streaming front  I suspect Wonder Woman would have done a lot better in a theater  You've had so many blockbusters held back for late 2021 or 2022  A lot of areas aren't open yet  Give it a few more months and you'll really see things take off   What's the point of that word salad?

There is very little difference when talking about hedge funds  In fact that distinction is just semantics in this setting and still the point stands  You would have a case in literally any other field except this one so I don’t know if you’re just trying to be petty or just are confused about what you’re referencing   As also someone who has spent the better part of a decade at multiple Universites Economics grad departments the person listening to an Econ PhD needs to be careful  For every 1 Econ PhD that is purely focused on the stock market and the economy there are 40 labor economists or really any other field but will stick to this one example  He is right that this means they need cash but that just means that they have decided the easiest way for them to fix a short term liquidity problem would be to get a short term loan than it would be for them to liquidate $600m in assets and then reassign them to where they want  This is literally less than 1/4 of a percent of their total assets and is likely to cover one or more current assets short term volatility that they believe will pay out more than it will cost them in interest on this short term loan  Hell they very well could have the funds on hand to cover it but realize those funds will earn more than it will cost them in interest short term in the market as well and as such did a basic business 101 move whereby no matter how much you have in your treasury you never personally bankroll anything that you can finance especially if you are a financial firm and especially when the rate is likely near one of its lowest points ever in over a century    But anyways your just being bit picky on semantics here  This is the one industry where they likely have not only control and the ability to sell and change how the funds they are in control of are invested but it is literally their duty and charge as a company  So while any other industry wouldn’t be able to completely fit and divest everything they are in control of here they can and likely have something silly like a warehouse line of a couple billion that they can utilize at any point which wouldn’t surprise me at all given the hundreds of billion that they handle  Hell I have direct family members with $145m warehouse lines so why would you think a massive multi-billion dollar company wouldn’t either  This is entirely click bait news it’s not like they are restructuring or filing chapter 11 they are just accessing a large credit line that they probably always had just only use every now and then  Hell I bet most large financial firms have lines like these and use them all the time but this is only reported because it involves the one that is on the other end of GME and the person reporting it doesn’t even realize this isn’t news worthy ,2021-03-16 17:20:19.967873

If you have margin they're a pretty good strategy  You want to have the cash ready but it will only use up a portion as compared to a straight limit order  You'll get a premium and reduce cost basis even further  Down side is if you really want the stock you might not get it and they only settle on Friday except for some ETF's and the longer you go the odds change ,2021-03-16 17:20:24.007383

GME DD: I start a poll to see how much each individual own GME stocks   500 people participate so far  Guess what I find ??? Around 50000 share of #GME   That’s 1/1000 of float   IF AND ONLY IF this sample is a good sample of population and 500000 people in WSB OWN the same amount people on WSB collectively own the whole float   Nobody can be sure until more people participate   A lot of people tell me that this will help hedge fund😂  My answer is simple hedge funds already knew how much they shorted and how much retail investors own but WE DONT   Nobody give us the real short interest  Not FINRA CNBC or the rest of them   Update1: 1400 people participate and they collectively own around 100000 shares  at least 85k that’s 2/1000 of float   If everybody participate we don’t need anybody to tell us the real short position    [vote how many GME you have ]https://linkto run/p/BMTK212Y,2021-03-16 17:21:24.191356

As you can see do ALMOST ALL OF THEM bet on the price being UNDER 200$ BY MARCH 19th  If the price is above 200$ til March 19th ALL PUTS IN THIS AREA WILL EXPIRE WORTHLESS !!  TLDR:  NO ONE REALLY NO ONE INCREASED OR DECREASED THEIR POSITION MASSIVELY!! But how did the price drop happen? You may ask  Well although GME may be on the SSR list IT DOESN'T MEAN THE HFs ARE NOT ABLE TO SHORT THE STOCK! That's a huge mistake people are partially spreading   There's really NO PROOF THAT RETAIL OR OTHER INSTITUTIONS SOLD THEIR POSITIONS!  IMO: JUST ANOTHER SHORT LADDER ATTACK TRYING TO SCARE YOU AND AN ATTEMPT TO EXECUTE YOUR STOP LOSSES AT SPECIFIC PRICE RANGES  I saw today as a GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY and bought even more stocks  I'm holding and I'm watching Bloomberg Terminal almost daily and that's the data I will stick to  I hope I could help you a bit at least and can encourage you to not panic but stay calm and look at fact-based data ",2021-03-16 17:22:15.104964

I work in steel industry  Cleveland owns arcelorMittal who is a plate an coil producer and as of 2/25 doesn’t have availability to place new order until may production period  Pricing is at a historic high while demand has begun to climb back to pre Covid levels  Currently there will be 1-2 more price hikes in coming months while the automotive sector begins to fix their supply chain issues  While they ramp up production coil availability is at all time low  Nucor who is the largest steel mfg by tonnage had to purchase coil on the open auction market instead of through their own scrap and raw metal processes further pushing up the price  Coil futures published in March expects price decreases approx aug 21’ and a continued slide into 22’  Although steel is strong now the current run in pricing is not feasible to maintain or continue  Do i believe a new floor for common material will be set after the current price falls off the Cliff? Yes it will never be as cheap as it was pre-pandemic but the price and growth models are not sustainable for a healthy business environment long term  Pricing will fall close to 40% of current pricing within a year assuming things continue to normalize but tubing and coil products have increased more than that    Is steel a safe buy? It is we will always use it but do consider they use blast furnaces so while the cost of energy goes up while consumers and manufacturing need cheaper costs to maintain profitable business  Their margins will shrink more comparatively than EAF producers and plates and coil is a whores market with thin margins in a typical market  I would consider Nucor or steel dynamics  Nucor sucks but they tend to set the market and are the domestic leaders and steel dynamics to me runs the best operation between Nucor gerdau and SDI  ArcellorMittal Nucor and SSAB are the main plate producers  Nucor does everything so in respect to wide range of market share they are on top    I’m no one special take this as you wish just my thoughts on the steel market and players ,2021-03-16 17:22:44.092986

Honestly everyone here is working with the assumption that the HFs are bleeding cash like crazy   I don't think they are   Think about all the people here who talk about how much money they could make if they were willing and able to play the volatility in the stock   Basically buy the dip sell at a peak repeat   There is so much volatility here that a retail investor could make a small fortune doing this IF they could time it right   &#x200B;  Now imagine a retail investor who is able to CREATE price movement   That's something the large traders have proven they can do   Borrow a million shares or so dump them into the market at key times trigger stop losses etc  to drop the price significantly  They can then quickly cover those shorts and net millions   Every time   Sure they were bleeding pretty badly on the initial run but if they can do long this enough they can cover those initial short losses and then some   Just think about today alone someone shorting a million shares at $208 could have made some major coin if they started buying and covering at $173 noting they drive the price up with re-buying so it isn't an automatic $35M in profit but still a very good few hours   &#x200B;  To me the volume of open calls seems more likely to trigger a true squeeze   It looks like the HFs are doing what they can to keep their volatility play from triggering large blocks of calls from moving ITM   If the price is driven too high and it triggers massive buying of shares from the call writers the HFs are going to feel pain on any of their open short positions    I still think enough retail investors holding and buying more can drive this eventually but it looks like it will be a long game of chicken and the HFs and call writers believe they can hold out longer   If everyone keeps throwing in their rent money in hopes that this will pop off in two days only to paper hand as soon as they don't see immediate massive returns the HFs could still win out   People need to invest WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD and HODL ,2021-03-16 17:23:26.017941

" EXPLANATION FOR ALL HAVING PROBLEMS TO READ THIS 80's S\*\*T:  First of all: ALTHOUGH it says on the one column 03/14/21 THE DATA IS NOT FROM 03/14/21 BUT FROM 03/16/21 SINCE RIGHT NEXT TO IT IS THE COLUMN WHERE IT SAYS ""CURRENT""   1st pic:  We can see a INCREASE of BUYERS and DECREASE of SELLERS  More buying people less selling people -> GOOD FOR APES  Besides this we can actually see that the percentage of Float Held increased aswell  But thats it for the first slide  Nothing to add no big changes to my last Bloomberg post THAT'S WHY A MASSIVE PRICE DROP LIKE TODAY IS UNLIKELY AND UNEXPLAINABLE   PLEASE look at the bottom right where it clearly says that really NO ONE decreased or increased their positions NOT EVEN RETAIL INVESTORS Investment Advisor Individual Private Equity Brokerage  REALLY NO ONE SOLD!!!  2nd pic:  As we can see theres no recently reported data look at the dates and don't panic when seeing red numbers on the picture BESIDES the Teachers Insurance just taking some profits since they're obviously not willing to take any risk its their fucking insurance I would'nt gamble it in Gamestop aswell they hodld until now and are taking profits -> totally fine no really big position -> Also no explanation why the price did drop as it did today  3rd pic:  On the 3rd picture we can see all important Call options expiring on March 19th  HUGE VOLUME if price is above 200$ on March 19th  Even more volume than on 210$/250$/300$   4th pic:  Sadly we can see that more people trading options are betting in decreasing stock prices of Gamestop  But how can that be good in any way? As you can see do ALMOST ALL OF THEM bet on the price being UNDER 200$ BY MARCH 19th  If the price is above 200$ til March 19th ALL PUTS IN THIS AREA WILL EXPIRE WORTHLESS !!  TLDR:  NO ONE REALLY NO ONE INCREASED OR DECREASED THEIR POSITION MASSIVELY!! But how did the price drop happen? You may ask  Well although GME may be on the SSR list IT DOESN'T MEAN THE HFs ARE NOT ABLE TO SHORT THE STOCK! That's a huge mistake people are partially spreading   There's really NO PROOF THAT RETAIL OR OTHER INSTITUTIONS SOLD THEIR POSITIONS!  IMO: JUST ANOTHER SHORT LADDER ATTACK TRYING TO SCARE YOU AND AN ATTEMPT TO EXECUTE YOUR STOP LOSSES AT SPECIFIC PRICE RANGES  I saw today as a GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY and bought even more stocks  I'm holding and I'm watching Bloomberg Terminal almost daily and that's the data I will stick to  I hope I could help you a bit at least and can encourage you to not panic but stay calm and look at fact-based data ",2021-03-16 17:23:48.001949

It just seems like you're running around being antagonistic and not really providing much value to any conversation   I get that the anonymity of Reddit allows people to impulsively indulge their true emotions and thoughts without fear of repercussion but I'm just confused on what kind of person spends their time being that way   Everyone else on here perceives your antagonism as a clear broadcast of insecurity anguish and internal frustration   Just relax man   Self reflection is a strong skill that most overlook and I'd suggest just not engaging with every asshole on here   And stop being one yourself   Not a happy or fun way to live   As far as responding to insults in real life I don't really have that problem   But if that's a serious question I probably have some advice for you and I'm open to a helpful dialogue   Just PM me ,2021-03-16 17:25:08.093010

Remember when GME went flat for a week and didn't move? That's because I bought an ootm straddle on it  Once those options expired worthless it took off    Yesterday I bought ootm straddle on NOK next week strike  This guarantees that the price of NOK will trade within a 5 cent range for the next 10 days ,2021-03-16 17:26:28.943128

It is really odd  UWMC accuses Rocket of bribing realtors into pushing customers to use Rocket which hasn't been proven  Then tells brokers who work with Rocket that they will not be able to use UWMC because Rocket's practice is basically cutting them out of mortgages  Then Rocket says UWMC is scared because they are losing market share and by agreeing to UWMC you won't be able to work with Rocket in the future and may impact the broker because Rocket is doing cool things   There is some mafia shit going down someone is going to have to investigate claims against the market ,2021-03-16 17:26:36.887856

Things are coming to a head in the next little while  ETFs rebalance on the 19th and they're heavily shorted so it's going to stir shit  Earnings is next week which is anticipated to be good plus it will release Gamestop from the gag order so they can start commenting on things  A letter from the shareholders has gone to Gamestop this week asking them to recall shares ask for an accounting of who owns what    That being said don't hold on to this friday as being the end of this shenanigans will abound  We can't keep talking about certain deadlines because then it just looks like a cult moving the goalposts  Just hold and be confident that Gamestop is worth a lot more than the share price indicates ,2021-03-16 17:26:54.016419

Bruh the logic is gone out of this sub  People thinking by holding they're screwing over hedge funds  The reality is there's just as many hedge funds hoping for GME to moon as there are wanting it to tank  So while Melvin and any other funds have lost a lot there's just as many HF's that have seen 1000%+ gains in the last few months    Some people around here really are retarded and think the only thing hedge funds do is bank on stock prices going down  Y'all realize HF's take both bearish AND bullish approaches to stocks right? lol,2021-03-16 17:27:16.106908

In my opinion IF there is are Long Whales that are pro squeeze they're at best contributing to the waves that are being created through natural demand meeting a highly price sensitive situation  If you look at the trend since December every time there is a run up the new low is roughly double the old  To make it makes more sense that the last two weeks were a number of shorts covering but there are always more shorts willing to pile on at the top so get ready for the next round near the end of the month ,2021-03-16 17:27:23.211741

The 5y inflation-indexed bond is trending downwards but the 5y has been pushed upwards so if 5y yields collapse then that 5y breakeven will also collapse?  ~~Wikipedia~~ Investopedia is saying that the inflation-indexed bond is tied to the CPI so it does play into that break-even metric  Good or bad   [https://www investopedia com/articles/bonds/09/inflation-linked-bonds asp]https://www investopedia com/articles/bonds/09/inflation-linked-bonds asp,2021-03-16 17:28:03.249307

What you need to understand about blackberry is that if they fired all of their employees and sat on their asses for the next five years they'd still make hundreds of millions just off their patents  Blackberry was the precursor to the modern smartphone  and holds a lot of patents on smartphone tech that are still relevant and will be for some time    But they aren't stupid  They knew they were done in the smartphone landscape when their clicky touchscreen phone launched in like 2010? Idk it was that big thing and when you pushed the screen it clicked down  Apparently it sucked I never had one   But anyway they learned from their mistake and instead invested in what they saw to be some of the next big developments in tech and innovation: namely cyber security autonomous vehicles smart cities etc   I met a BB recruiter in 2016 at a job fair that gave me the best free pen I've ever received and told me how BB was trying to shift their public perception from a defunct smartphone maker to a cyber security firm   Imo from 2020-2040 they are poised to be what apple/amazon/tesla was from 2000-2020,2021-03-16 17:34:53.055882

I wasn’t born into wealth  I was born into a middle class family  I went to college and dropped out to follow my girlfriend at the time down to Florida  I was working at an electronics store similar to Best Buy and this guy came in one day with a computer issue  He wasn’t the easiest person to work with but I helped him out  A few weeks later I got a call from some lady asking if I would be available for a job interview  It was very odd but I only made like $15 an hour at the time and was struggling I was 21 living on my own so I went for the interview  The lady happened to be the guy I helped earlier’s assistant  The guy thought I was too qualified to be at a retail store and wanted to see if I was interested in working for him  He owned a mid sized FinTech company and hired me that day   I went from $15 an hour at 21 to $70k a year at 22  That large jump in income was more than I could spend so I saved it and maxed out my 401k  It’s 9 years later and I still work for the guy have a family now  I have never been able to grow out of the mindset of constantly struggling to get by and I save every penny I make  Much more so than a normal person ,2021-03-16 17:38:34.955561

My thoughts  I fully expect more fuckery tomorrow to try drive the price even lower  I've had plenty of opportunity to take a small bit of profit but haven't so by this point knowing how hard someone wants this lower and the lengths they will go to  I'm thinking instead of taking measly pennies at this price after all this    I ain't making it easy for them     It was money I was prepared to lose so Id rather gain nothing by this point as they try hard to push it down  They can prise these shares out of my cold dead hands ,2021-03-16 17:42:02.233293

If you’re new and down don’t be hard on yourself I was where you were and it took me years to understand the ins and outs  Just a few quick tips: singing to the stocks helps but only if it’s a song the stock market likes otherwise it bombs  Begging your stock as you stare at it for hours sometimes help but it’s reliable for sustained growth  Petting your cat will make the stock moon but ONLY if the cat comes to you if you seek out the cat and pet it it will be a red day  Pray to a god keep cycling through them until you find one that makes the stock go upI’ve had luck with Hermès Greek god of trade and commerce that’s it folks  It’s all just math  Good luck out there,2021-03-16 17:43:47.049565

One of those is a big boy the other is not  WeBull has pretty graphs but it is not in the big 4 at all    Big 4:   Charles Schwab   Fidelity   E*Trade   TD Ameritrade    I use Schwab but fidelity has the best customer service super short holding times and friendly/helpful agents  Schwab has pretty good customer service in my experience  Customer Service will matter a lot to you when you transfer holdings as well as if something weird happens  Furthermore the little brokers make their money in ways you may not like such as loaning your shares to margin without giving you income  Schwab and Fidelity you have to opt in and you get monthly income for that WeBull you have to opt out and you get nothing  That’s something right there you’d want good customer service,2021-03-16 17:43:50.351241

1  Putting dates on a squeeze I'll stand by this is irresponsible and hurts the possibility of it  When X date arrives and people are expecting a 1000% return and that doesn't happen its discouraging  If it's going to happen it'll happen in its own time and I dont think anyone can possibly see it coming thats just the nature of the market though    TL:DR No one can truly predict when something like that will happen   2  Not necessarily with such low volume the stock is easier to push around I encourage you to look at inverstopedia for low volume price movements  Itll explain it better than I can  I expect some green and some red days  What I'm really looking for is sustaining certain price levels and checking for resistance    Hope this helps!,2021-03-16 17:44:29.424331

No it’s not what a squeeze is but it’s the catalyst  Think about it people dump their stimulus in GME inflating the price  Once a bunch of people are in at a high point they won’t sell because they won’t want to loose money  Diamond handing it at that point  That gets the squeeze going because the price will be above $300 and sustained ,2021-03-16 17:46:23.303717

All the big brokers went to zero commission stock trades  Options is $ 65 a contract which is nothing  They own etf’s and mutual funds  They are used for corporate 401k accounts  They have real financial advisors you can hire  Most of their money wasn’t from retail stock trades so they matched the new apps that came out fairly quickly,2021-03-16 17:48:12.022317

"You link your infotainment screen in your car to your bank card  You navigate to fuel section  Tap the button which says ""I need fuel"" and tap your amount  The money leaves your bank and you get a notification that a shell fuel drone has been launched to your location  A few minutes later you see a drone fly to your vehicle and attach itself to your gas tank  It stays attached and fills you up while you are moving or stopped  After the required fuel has been topped up it detaches then flys back go the fuel storage location ",2021-03-16 17:48:17.684574
No  RKT was a great quick play if you bought options and flipped them  People were called shills for promoting it  It’s still a great play IMO and holding shares and calls  AMC was/is a play too if you got in at the right PP  I personally read every DD that’s posted here and don’t really see anything other than the meme stocks  I’d love to jump on more plays  I’m still new to investing less than a year but since joining this sub and a handful of others I’m learning a lot ,2021-03-16 17:48:17.684697

Question:  One thing I don't understand is if they've shorted so many shares and need to buy them all back and we're waiting for that squeeze what's to stop them from buying them back in portions with each of these attacks?  Won't they slowly end up buying back most of what they owe enough to prevent the big squeeze and assert some damage control?  I'm not saying they will do this   Clearly they're fucked and scrambling and I have every intention to hold   I just don't understand the process ,2021-03-16 17:49:00.093505

"No but the math can still hold up  I can use the apple box example again:  Say 51% of the apples in the box are ""mediocre"" or let's say a 5/10 rating  The other 49% are completely rotten or 0/10 rating   Quick math shows that the entire box of apples averaged together REALLY is closer to 2 5/10 ""rating"" but since more than half are at mediocre it can be packaged as if the whole box were rated 5/10  The S&P only looks at the majority it doesn't average them out  So long as 51% of the apples are a 5/10 the entire box gets rated 5/10 the other 49% of the apples can literally be defaulted garbage   I know that it's a lame way of putting it trying to boil it down to an ELI5 though it can be much more complicated  The general point remains and even if no corruption/manufacturing/manipulation were occurring hint: it isn't then the rating on the bond can STILL mean that it's just a pile of shit ",2021-03-16 17:49:50.121048

Just agreeing with you  Streaming services will never go away but the movie theater is an experience that is tested and true  After a year of this bullshit people want OUT  CA opened some AMC theaters yesterday to a mask-required 40% capacity audience and they filled the seats  People are ready to live a life  Seeing a movie in the theater is an experience Netflix can't provide  Same with concerts  That kind of thing is a staple in the entertainment sector ,2021-03-16 17:50:21.162642

If nobody else is selling then they will be just selling the new shares they borrow and but them back  They can do it all day long but how will that help in covering their shorts? If anything when it dips possibly other longs and retailers are also buying some so they are essentially digging a deeper hole  Again this is all based on the premise that others selling is minimal to none ,2021-03-16 17:52:48.989098

As far as I know they haven't announced they're bringing the dividend back and they haven't paid that out since 3/2019  The reinstatement of the dividend crossed my mind the other day as what could be the single greatest catalyst for movement  The shorts would have to pay on those shares on top of the short interest they've accumulated already  Especially if GME has a good earnings report and has cash on hand it's in the realm of possibility ,2021-03-16 17:52:50.773321

Depends what you mean by long-term really  If you're willing to hold for years and you bought sub-100 you probably can't go too wrong   Bear Case: Very long-term they have a long way to go to be worth above 100  I know the projects to send the whole firm online etcetc but it's not done yet  They are discussing it  Then they'll have to actually execute it  Everybody wants to go online and very few manage to find their marks in the online world  Unfortunately the world doesn't NEED gamestop even if it moves online   Bull case: They COULD make themselves indispensable if they manage to secure critical hardware suppliers contract  If the only way to buy the new PS6 is through online Gamestop in 2027 then yeh they could be huge  Or if they somehow manage to sell something else that's gaming related but not covered mobile gaming?   All in all though i'm rather pessimistic  The market is so saturated so fast if you arrive first you have a 50/50 chance of losing  If you aren't even first    We'll just have to wait and see  This is just my opinion and i'm not the patron deity of traders,2021-03-16 17:52:51.934691

> The HF's have most likely synthetically shorted GME via ETF's to drive its price down since then  They can also legally disguise their short position via synthetic longs and there's concrete evidence that they have done this on the various articles posted before   > When coupled with synthetic longs via options gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't takes GME off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be and provides the ability to naked short GME again  This was the missing piece of how GME could actually be shorted without appearing so  This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive GME down outside of buying a put   How do HFs disguise their short position via synthetic longs?

I believe that may be incorrect  First X and Y conditions must be met then the rule can be implemented no later than 10 days after X and Y conditions are met  I believe that's where everyone is confusing the 10 days being the 19th when the rule is in place  X and Y conditions have not been meet yet  See this DD for an in depth explanation  There's a very high probability the new SLD rules won't be in place for a while https://www reddit com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m55mvf/dtcc_rulemaking_timeline_other_sleep_aids/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share,2021-03-16 17:53:26.128581

Speculation but it's playing on human emotions    If you read the amount of FUD and downsiders in here when it falls    That's exactly the sentiment they want to scare away holders and bulls   People put lots of emotion into investing because the money is valuable to us   For a hedge it's easier to spend millions dumping the stock over get called and have to buyback shares at God knows what price it might settle down at    Scare people into giving up shares less people to pay out later on ,2021-03-16 17:53:26.767777

I mean they can  Nothing is stopping them from doing that  One could argue that's part of what sparked the initial spike from $45 to $91 right before market close that started this second run up    &#x200B;  Essentially for anyone that shorted the stock it's a crucial decision of timing  The longer they wait to cover the shorts the more they pay in interest  But that interest payment could be worth it if they wait long enough and they can cover when the price is much below where they shorted    Personally I'd argue that most of the shorts that were taken out in early January or late 2020 have probably already covered  These are new shorts that are causing issues to those that shorted them    &#x200B;  But yes they could just slowly cover over a long period and keep the price high but never a squeeze  However this would mean that they are bleeding from both covering at a high price and paying interest payments for a while  But that may be cheaper at the end of it all than them risking a squeeze and having to buy back everything for a ridiculously inflated price  Understand that nothing about this is guaranteed or definite and anyone telling you so is lying ,2021-03-16 17:53:42.872081

NBD   What they're doing is driving the prices of the $15 call down as far as they can so they can use those to cover   Interestingly enough the most traded call today was the 17 5 with 14 5k volume  That is HUGE volume on something that is OTM   I really have a strong feeling you'll be fine ,2021-03-16 17:54:08.015839

> But yes they could just slowly cover over a long period and keep the price high but never a squeeze  However this would mean that they are bleeding from both covering at a high price and paying interest payments for a while  But that may be cheaper at the end of it all than them risking a squeeze and having to buy back everything for a ridiculously inflated price  Understand that nothing about this is guaranteed or definite and anyone telling you so is lying   I see   Well thank you for taking the time to explain it so clearly ,2021-03-16 17:55:20.243167

I'm just a truck driver man  I look at that stuff and I understand some of it and the rest I can't even read on my smartphone    Y'all say SI is maybe up to 900% and they say it's down to 27%  Hell they even testified to congress that they covered   We've seen some big gains but that seems to be mostly due to whales and other HF and today the price dropped way down to 179  Their goals are clearly not ours  Its just too much risk for me when I've already lost 20k on bb and pltr and nok   If I get knocked down to zero it's going my to be too hard to climb back up  20k is probably nothing to many of you  It's certainly nothing it to HF    I need to win some before I can stand to lose ,2021-03-16 17:55:36.754215

Who insures    wtf? Literally no one *has* to buy the shares  The shorts could keep paying the %interest until the share owners demand the shares back but they don't have to  Also GME can only hit 10k if literally no one sells for less AND SOMEONE BUYS IT AT 10K   The money you will be taking is whoever buys the shares  A short squeeze puts them in a position to buy or lose tons of money  They could literally hold out best they can and wait for the price to come back down if they have the money to do so  The only shares they HAVE to buy are from exercised calls   More than likely the money you'll get for selling will be from someone here ,2021-03-16 17:55:54.277773

To anyone that actually understands economics:  Bond yields rising and the threat of stagflation are impacting the markets but wouldn't it be wise for investors to actually *keep* money in the market because equities should continue to remain inflated? The sectors that are supposedly inflationary hedges are also pretty red  It doesn't seem likely that so many people are rushing to 10 and 20 year bonds because of such a marginal increase that it would so drastically impact the market   Why the fuck is everything getting wrecked? Shouldn't the market benefit or at least be relatively unaffected by inflation? The SP 500 still cancelled out inflation during the hyperinflation from 69-80 so why the fuck is everything tanking in this case?,2021-03-16 17:56:09.233782

Th squeeze happens when shorts cover they will only do that if they think the price is at a low point   the most recent pump was caused by shorts covering when the stock was low it won’t bounce again until they cover  Let’s estimate that 1000 people dump their stimmy into GME that’s $1 4mil or about 6300 shares at the current price  009% of  shares  How many people do you think are going to dump stimmy? It would take over 100000 people dumping stimmy at these prices to even equal a percentage of shares ,2021-03-16 17:58:53.836469

But none of his friends have the heart to tell him he's absolutely fucked so they just say ""of course buddy  We'll get you patched up and soon you'll be home with your wife and kids while everyone calls you a hero!""

Those bonds are still investment-grade bonds  But yeah the bond market is a bit crooked as we all saw in 2008 so I don't take it the ratings to mean too goddamned much   Regardless if GME were heavily shorted there wouldn't be so many shares available on IBKR and short rates wouldn't be so low  If you believe that Interactive Brokers and other brokers are manipulating even *that* then I don't know what to tell you -- you've made up your mind and no amount of evidence to the contrary is bound to change it ,2021-03-16 17:59:37.802420

Could use some advice from my fellow apes    &#x200B;  I have 100 shares of AMC @ 11 33 avg  I Sold to open a call for $11 back when it was at like $9  Which I realize is kinda dumb cause if it exercises I lose money on it whereas if I did a $12 strike I would have made some profit either way     &#x200B;  My question is at this point I don't think it's going to drop below $11  Should I buy to close the contract so I keep my shares? I feel like I'd make more money if I just closed it now and resold another contract or wait for AMC to go up and sell my shares which would get me more profit in the long run    &#x200B;  Help?,2021-03-16 18:00:05.645914

Hard to say ideally somewhere in the 100s since even with these dips you’ve stayed profitable but I dont forsee it staying in the 100s any longer  Any averaging down will help if its within your risk tolerance even if its just 1 at the current price  Just have a bit of money ready to go and wait for the next dip,2021-03-16 18:00:14.889437

So honest question: let's say the squeeze happens and GME shoots straight THROUGH the moon  Melvin wouldn't have the funds to pay those prices by a long shot and would declare bankruptcy unless they got a MASSIVE bailout  But the only people who WOULD buy GME after it went through the moon IS Melvin because of their short positions   So if the squeeze happens and Melvin declares bankruptcy wouldn't that drop GME stock back down like a meteorite since no one else has the kind of stock-purchasing short-covering obligation as Melvin which in this hypothetical scenario went bankrupt?,2021-03-16 18:00:32.045057

So Parr is the main fuel distributor to the Hawaiian islandswhere I live since Covid we have had a devastated tourism economy and so fuel demand had plummeted  Now that people are getting vaccinated and buying plane tickets first thing our fuel demands have skyrocketed and parr has been killing it  They just took a hit because they offered a massive buy to raise funds and settle some debts but I think this is the best time to buy the dip  I’m in 125 shares and I’m riding it out  Thanks for coming to my Ted talk,2021-03-16 18:01:30.627135

You are right that as literal companies Amazon and GameStop are not really comparable but imo the situation I was describing is  Lot's of people including me see the pivot GME has been pulling off and see the current price as a bargain for what it could be like many who bought into Amazon   In your opinion what is keeping GameStop from reaching the same scale? I'm genuinely curious and want to hear more about your philosophy on the topic ,2021-03-16 18:01:35.029613

Nothing's really tanking yet but valuations are very high   When companies are valued in proportion to future earnings and rates rise which is expected in an inflationary environment the time value of money is impacted   $100 next year is worth less than $100 today   If rates are low the gap is closer since you couldn't be doing much better with your money now   But if rates are high and you could be getting a good return elsewhere you're willing to pay a lot less today for that $100 next year   Tech is particularly vulnerable here where the value comes from the prospect of high growth and profitability that may not be reached for quite a while   If rates are high you aren't willing to bet quite as much on the come because you can get a better return than you otherwise would in fixed income   That's my understanding of it anyway ,2021-03-16 18:01:40.192539

So they CEO of Tesla is an idiot because he made a statement that oversold how safe Teslas are? He jumped to a conclusion prematurely without giving real consideration to what the video results actually meant because he was hoping for that result  That doesn't mean he's an idiot it means he fell into the trap of confirmation bias - something we all do  It's just unfortunate nobody reeled him back from making this statement   The statement itself is also not entirely untrue either: Volvos and Teslas *are comparable* in safety ratings  And while the video you shared does quantify g-forces experienced in those crashes it doesn't quantify cabin intrusion which is definitely a consideration in a crash like that  The Tesla clearly appears to perform better in that category so it was really just that Musk needed to clarify that statement to only apply to the comparison of that kind of crash ,2021-03-16 18:03:39.920414

Welp I don't think this will be your average earnings call  Yes we expect the numbers to be good courtesy of new consoles  But more importantly its the first time we'll actually hear from GME the company since all this madness happened   Additionally there is an assumption of some announcements/CFO/digital strategy etc which could be catalysts to help drive the stock price up also   Basically this is not just good earnings = stonk goes up  GME is in the middle of a short squeeze of sorts / on the cusp of going higher  Any good news is a trigger for more buying at this point ,2021-03-16 18:08:53.082222

I’m just imagining a total shit-show where in-store gorilla ambassadors keep injuring customers  For the first time GameStop has to figure in food waste because nobody wants to buy bananas at a GameStop  Most of the new products do okay but the Bluetooth-enabled smart crayons lead to lawsuits as customers assume they are edible despite containing small lithium batteries ,2021-03-16 18:09:44.875670

The lower prices are bullshit right now  Look at the volume on all your stocks  Nok for example is 26 mil when avg vol is 90+ mil  If the volume today is 25% of the avg it means everyone is on the sideline until tomorrow and the people that arent yet are selling to wait  This means if the speech is bullish all the stocks are going to moonshot so I’m taking the risk,2021-03-16 18:09:59.042584

I don't think the spending is correct  Poors like us might need to liquidate our investments but institutional money is still around and they definitely move it into specific sectors  The only thing that should theoretically totally collapse the absurd valuations we have on growth stocks would be a rate increase  Until then money has literally nowhere else to go that would make long term sense except for inflationary hedges ,2021-03-16 18:10:06.935590

Disagree  There's no fundamental reason for GME to be above $200 a share  It's just not a >$10 billion company  The *only* reason behind its price is a squeeze play  Shorts know they were caught with their pants down so they're trying to mitigate the damage as much as possible  The way they're doing that is with naked price manipulation as seen in the pump and dump last week  Technical analysis is the only correct way to make any play besides a hold ,2021-03-16 18:12:29.185024

Yep I agree with you there  However I don't think there was as much shorting pressure as there was buying pressure -- as evidenced by the low short float and low short fees from the beginning of the February squeeze  Sure there was a small squeeze but I think most of the bags were dumped on retail ,2021-03-16 18:15:39.129486

Cohen ain’t buying shares at one fitty  He’s also isn’t really up 2300% or whatever  On paper the share price suggests that but when you are that vested you can’t just sell and take gains like we can  He knows he’s sitting a bunch of fake paper gains that he can’t really even cash in  Hopefully the Ace up his sleeve is something like an acquisition or some new direction for the company that would actually validate a price per share in the 200 range  That would send shares flying to a zillion and trigger all sorts squeezes before it resettles    We haven’t heard dick form game stop execs so hopefully some news drops on the earnings call first time we hear them speak since this began really to create hype and trigger squeezing ,2021-03-16 18:15:49.050319

Don’t think like that  That sort of mind set brings massive amounts of fomo as for what app to use that’s all on you and your location a little bit of research should get you going in the right direction  I’m us based I like fidelity but doesn’t mean I don’t use other brokers    How to average down? Let’s say you have 1000 to spend since this is a hype stock don’t just throw 1k all in because then you feel the drops get an idea of when a rally or the direction of the movement and that’s when you start to buy more  Let’s say you got in at 250 for two yesterday that’s gives you 500 today to buy dips and at 200ish today if you got two more your average would be 225 ,2021-03-16 18:16:25.731676

The squeeze absolutely doesn't happen if there is a massive selloff   Price drops calls aren't ITM so don't need to be covered and the shorts are happy to buy back shares they borrowed at $150-$200 for $40   That would be the best outcome for them and the reason they shorted GME in the first place   I can't even follow how you would think that would happen if a large number of people sell off ,2021-03-16 18:18:38.083524

Has anyone looked at the log book order flow and noticed that there have consistently been anywhere from 7-12 lines of same volume number requested for either a sell or buy and usually about 0 05 to 0 07 apart? Seems to be a ladder attack up? I've been monitoring it for the last several weeks and seeing these patterns emerge is quite interesting let alone confusing  Its certainly manipulating the stock in such a way that it is preventing it from mooning by keeping the price relatively low and on a more narrow trajectory  This was occurring in just the same fashion before the first major dip at around $348  Anyone else noticing this?

Nothing necessarily wrong but Rocket does both retail and wholesale mortgages  They’ve done some things to vulture potential clients from brokers directly  into their retail mortgages pissing brokers off  UWM used this fact and their faster turnaround/ better service to leverage the ultimatum  Basically brokers were incentivized to side with UWM because Rocket doesn’t need brokers and UWM has better services,2021-03-16 18:19:50.941892

I've been thinking this too  They were a dividend stock until 3/2019 so it isn't out of the question and would be tough to battle as manipulation  Especially considering the reinvigorated interest and an ER on the way which will probably be very positive  The case is rock solid  They just like that we like the stock ,2021-03-16 18:19:52.040238

Depends on your brokers collateral requirements  Generally the lower your assignment risk the lower the collateral requirements are    You can also leverage margin as collateral without incurring any interest on it because you technically haven’t actually borrowed anything until you are assigned,2021-03-16 18:20:17.689895
Only rebuy the call if you expect the stock will continue climbing  If you think it’s sideways or down slightly wait to let that time premium drop    Tbh if you really think AMC is gonna continue to rise you’d get better ROI by buying a new call at a higher strike and letting the old mistake roll  That’s your risk to take I’m busy with other plays ,2021-03-16 18:20:17.690013

Evidently not? It traded at under 200 for over an hour  It then had an sudden spike in volume that put it above it then traded sideways again because retail can't move prices then oh look another spike that increased before trading sideways     You have no clue what you're on about why the fuck do you think this needs whales and hedge funds and mass options buying to move and apply pressure in the first place?  Because retail can't do shit  Just look at the entire sideways trading of Feb to see  Just look at the fact it takes 20 minutes to drop from 348 and a week to trade at 200 ,2021-03-16 18:20:40.004051

This is just algorithms trading to keep the stock at a certain price target   Truth is without huge buying pressure they're basically able to set the price by trading their shares back and forth   This is the exact reason why many are arguing the price you see is not actually the tangible value of the stock   Think of it this way: You want to buy a PS5 but you only have $300 not the $500 required  So you get your friend to sell you his $300 and then sell it back to him for $300 10  Now you guy into GameStop and try to tell them the price of a PS5 is only $300 10 not the $500 list price because your buddy just sold you his for that price so that must be the market price ,2021-03-16 18:22:38.149007

If folks go 'stimmi in' in theory the price should not be moved much  The only caveat is that supply will drop  It will still be based on the shorts not having the supply at desired cost value to fill the orders  Interesting to think about for sure 👍,2021-03-16 18:25:27.986206

It doesn’t but the comment I replied to said stop telling people to sell which OP never said  It is a five year old account and has a history of supporting GME it’s not some new bot account  Maybe he just assumed with the recent run up of GME there is a ton of gains looking for a new home ,2021-03-16 18:25:36.391868

So basically nothing he will ever do will ever matter then? If your parents do fucked up things you are automatically invalidated  The vast majority of the capital came from the selling of his other businesses/stocks   Everything I’m reading says he actually paid for his schooling himself and took on 100k in debt  Even if his parents did pay for his schooling which it looks like they did so what? We no for a fact that any monetary investments made by his family was a fraction of what he is worth now  Is he just never allowed to take credit for anything he does?,2021-03-16 18:25:51.840625

All money in SA was tied to apartheid    Like I’m not saying he’s some evil dude but to say he’s a self made saint is something I want to counter    Dude was raised on blood money and was able to make an name for himself like a child of a slave owner    Does that make him bad?

Yeah if this is MM then everyone who likes McDonald's hamburgers is manipulating the fast food market by purchasing them  It's just such a retarded play by them  The only way it's ever going to fly is on some legal technicality and even then I don't see a lot of room for them to do anything with it  What are they going to argue? That DFV being transparent about his position is MM?  Now one thing they could do is try to maneuver and say reddit is enabling this community and thus potentially liable  Since reddit is allergic to bad media coverage it might be night night for WSB and GME subs   I hate even mentioning that because it might give them the idea but apes are better off knowing its a possibility I think  Plus if I can think of that surely they can too ,2021-03-16 18:27:01.810654

As I recall he was responsible for allowing a paid trading course on our sidebar and switched our Discord to the one run by this service  They stood to make something between $2k and $4k per paid user   I would accuse that of being a common trading scam since nobody sells a goose that lays golden eggs  Reddit didn't like that and removed him   How many times have they interviewed this guy again? They bought his movie rights they did a photoshoot they even allowed him to say he wasn't removed from /r/wallstreetbets live on air  I heard anyway I didn't watch it ,2021-03-16 18:27:02.915620

Or the fact that     There  Is  No  Float   They can't possibly cover because they can't physically cover with real shares  Today tomorrow the next days price doesn't matter in the end because there are NO non- synthetic shares for them to close out as the currently lie in diamond hands whether those hands are institutions or otherwise   Thats the trouble with naked shorting and being caught before being able to close those out   They may be able to close there legit shorts in due time as some people paperhand out and that has been a very slow process so far    Diamond hands hold well over the float because of naked shorts those shares need to be returned just the same   No reason for etfs to be shorted which kicks the can if there was no can to be kicked ,2021-03-16 18:27:50.969130

My theory is that there was  Melvin said that they no longer had short positions but that they did have a lot of puts    My theory is that those could be synthetic shorts  They sold a naked call and bought a naked put    So when whoever was the one that caused the option chain that triggered this second squeeze activated their bomb those apparently worthless calls started to be itm making the shorts have to buy shares    This is all speculation but it would explain why there were reported loses from some hedge funds this second time too ,2021-03-16 18:28:04.776985

Its not about liquidating investments or money moving anywhere when there is inflationary pressure and if the fed steps in to raise rates the money supply literally shrinks and its effects are economically contractive i e companies do worst  Institutions like MFs that could not go short factors in this risk of fed raising rates and reduce their positions others not constrained would could go short  Money Isint forced to be long assets,2021-03-16 18:28:09.929610

But these 900k volume also count stocks twice if a stock gets bought and sold again  It also doesn’t differentiate between buy and sell volume  If 900k stocks were bought in the same time you can expect a massive price jump    Also not including: short ladder attacks by HFs imply the repeating sell of stocks to another HF in a very short period of time  This would also create a lot of „volume“ but in reality the same stock gets sold and bought back again every few seconds ,2021-03-16 18:35:41.374185

you are talking about 'power' level of capital    Sure some individuals and many institutions have the power to invest a couble billion to completely fuck the shorts but will they? They have the power already and have likely their goals as well for which they acquired that capital  For not it is unclear if their goals align with WSB the future books will tell that tale or not   Plenty of greedy young wannabe Gordon Geckos hunting to make their mark with a couple hundred mill on Wall Street and get the bragging rights to next summer's coctail party on the country club though   These are the sharks that get roped into situations like this naturally and they can work in our favor as well,2021-03-16 18:36:57.125965

It's interesting to see the same timing of the price attacks occuring for the last three days and want to go on record for people to take that into consideration when buying and selling especially for these weeklies    I haven't seen anything as of yet that is thesis invalidating due to the drop being related to the price vs bad news or anything of that matter   ,2021-03-16 18:37:56.026097
Sure I certainly agree with that sentiment assuming their intent is exactly as everyone believes and so far we don't have any evidence to the contrary   Even if Kenneth Griffin was concocting some grand scheme to steal from the rich and transfer it to the poor we'd never actually know because no one would ever believe him unless he somehow managed to put the whole plan in a time capsule that can be verified long after the date everything transpires   He did contribute $15 million to a charity called Robin Hood  LOL   Alas I'm with you  I want these fuckers to burn to the ground too  Just thought it was an interesting spin ,2021-03-16 18:37:56.026206

Gold worked terrifically as money and living standards increased most rapidly in countries like America whilst they had a gold standard  The reason the gold standard was ditched was because as always governments wanted to spend far more than they had in reserves so they decided they’d print more receipts than they had reserves of physical metal  Eventually countries call bullshit and start withdrawing their money and the government has to leave the standard altogether onto a fiat system of no value whatsoever other than blind faith  In Britain in the 19th century the inflation rate for 100 years was 0%  Because gold is a stable store of value unlike fiat currency which loses 5% of its purchasing power every year whilst median salaries are flat  It is the most evil and insidious tax on the public because they don’t understand it  Gold ties the hands of governments and central banks hence why they hate it so much  We will one day return to a physical asset backed currency it may just take a few more years ,2021-03-16 18:38:11.223206

There's no upside limit but no that's not realistic at all  Not because it can't be pushed that high but because someone would step in before then  Likely GME's board would do a split way before then  That wouldn't really stop the growth but it would create more volume which could end a squeeze situation  Or like with VW a settlement is reached to save the shorts from themselves for the good of the stock     A run up to that level would do a lot of weird things to the entire market  No one knows really but it wouldn't be good  There would be plenty of incentive to get it under control before then  That said it's an extremely low probability of that sort of melt up    The honest answer to your question is literally no one has any idea where the top is or how it plays out  Just do your research and constantly adjust to new information as it unfolds ,2021-03-16 18:39:29.954399

This actually makes more sense as a Retail-investors-holding-GME analogy than it does for its original purpose   Granted it's a creative way to show roof tiles protecting your home    but much more effective demonstrating the emotions a bunch of apes and retards feel riding this GME rollercoaster   To the moon bitches   ,2021-03-16 18:39:56.476704

Bro they don’t get paid shit and their hours have been significantly cut with Covid  I was trying to convince them to invest too  But some of them just don’t have the disposable income due to significantly reduced hours     The manager was telling me he had 65 hours to disperse among 4 employees and he was required to take a mandatory 44 hours    Most of these guys had to get a second job it’s crazy ,2021-03-16 18:39:57.095209

"\>Ok first off  I don't think anyone got offended  That word is thrown around a lot      Nah dawg maybe \*you\* didn't get offended but for someone to go out of their way to track them on reddit and harass them they were definitely offended      \>They simply made a bet and didn't follow through  People followed up on it  They got called out  Lesson learned  At least they didn't make a big bet in person to someone and get beat to shit  Maybe this will help them with that in life   &#x200B;  This part I don't disagree with  Making someone own up to their word and calling them out for lying isn't a bad thing  That's not the wrong part  The wrong part is literally harassing him like he's describing  He's harassing a 15 year old on his social media page because he didn't follow through with a stupid bet  No matter how you flip it that's bad   &#x200B;  \>Proof or ban  Period  Maybe this sub isn't for you?

CNN is objectively a fucking terrible network with a partisan agenda  They are the complete mirror opposite to FOX's pundit shows like Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity except CNN acts like those jokes on their entire network   Anyone who watches CNN and trusts what they're spewing should be made fun of just as much as anyone who gets all their news from Sean Hannity   [https://mediabiasfactcheck com/cnn/]https://mediabiasfactcheck com/cnn/,2021-03-16 18:42:15.926974

No because there is no psychological component to a roulette wheel   No matter how much everyone bets it will stop on black it will stop where it stops   Stock prices absolutely follow the sentiments of the people making the bets   If enough people or money bet a stock will get to $x 00 that's where it will end up ,2021-03-16 18:42:19.608939

Nah homie  To go and ask someone to post proof or take their ban isn't harassment  This is showing poor responsibility on your part  And you keep doubling down on this harassment/offended thing    Also what proof do you have of harassment? He simply stated he dmed him and the kid told him he was 15  And then he said he deleted his account  So point me at the harassment  If talking to people is harassment to you  Hy shit are you softer than duck shit  Otherwise it sounds like you are making this up in your head to get triggered and reeeeeeeee on wsb about someone you don't know  Or do you    Maybe you are the 15 year old kid  Who knows it's the fucking internet  And it's a fucking reddit account its not the end of the world  And people make throw away accounts on reddit all the time  It's easy cost nothing    So again show me the post where he is harassing the kid or please stfu  Proof or ban ,2021-03-16 18:45:46.728371

Ok think about it this way everyone holds assets expecting some form of return for a given level of risk what happens if the feds raise rates? Basically the risk premium for equities will decrease  Now the more conservative institutions would say hey i can achieve the risk/returns ratio i want with less equities and more bonds because the feds gonna raise rates so high so what do they do? They reduce their equity position  If lots of larger holder sells prices drops risk premium/returns of equities are further reduces causing further sell offs  Now other firms anticipating this what do they do? They obviously want to jump ahead of the queue and sell first right? Some firms even go short   The whole market is basically everyone trying to one up each other guessing each other future moves will be and the thats what the current price reflects - aggregate of what all people guesses are    Not saying that the fed will raise rates early but thats what some people think,2021-03-16 18:49:16.882633

There is a magical formula on how many shares need to be hedged in order to remain delta neutral    [https://www investopedia com/terms/d/deltahedging asp]https://www investopedia com/terms/d/deltahedging asp   The closer an ITM contract comes to expiration the closer the delta goes to 1    Thus if you buy 1 call on something that has a delta of 1 they have to hedge 100 shares to cover it  If the delta is  8 then it is 80 shares #ofCalls \* delta = hedge  I can't say with any certainty that this is actually the formula that is used by MM but it is in the same ballpark ,2021-03-16 18:52:49.669172

What's the strike on your calls?   I mean looking at the chart this thing has done basically nothing but go down for the last 5 years    This honestly seems like the type of play you're making just because it's cheap  What's actually happening is you have guys writing covered calls and taking your money knowing they'll never have to pay out    If you want something that has a realistic chance of paying off just do $SPY calls  It just made a nice little dip so 3/19 $400c are on sale for $0 66  SPY doesn't have to go in the money for you to profit  A $2 increase in SPY will gain you $25-40 depending on how quick the run-up is    This isn't financial advice  I'm just giving my opinion    Hell I just bought one contract @ 66 while I was writing this comment  I have a very small account so if my $66 turns into $100 I'll be happy ,2021-03-16 18:57:55.788706

"Let's say you as a country want to invest in mental health or universal healthcare to save money over time in terms of addiction and crime as well as other interconnected issues and/or improve quality of life if you don't have the budget for it it takes far longer to implement if you're not using a fiat currency to take out debt    Also with automation reducing wages over time you're eventually going to have to find a way to supplement wages if you want quality of life to increase for the average person and as far as I know thats far easier to do with fiat currency if you want to keep a market based economy that is    Look at the roman empire and how they gradually debased their currency because they ran out of silver and started ""watering down"" their currency by putting less silver in it  Unless you're suggesting that we invade other countries to sustain near exponential currency growth to accomdate exponential market growth due to continous technological innovation   Most empires fell when their economies could no longer sustain imperial expansionism to accumulate more currency to sustain growth  The problem isn't fiat currency it's the mismanagement of currency that causes this issue especially when it comes to being able to truly evaluate what a company service housing etc  is truly worth    That's easier with non fiat currency but it still has the issue of limited cumulative value of all buisnesses within the country you'd need more of said precious resource to add value to your country after all and any system that would circumnavigate this issue with non fiat currency will have the same issues as fiat    It would honestly be better to have an AI manage the economy in terms of what somethings worth eventually the only issue there is insuring that the parameters of what something is worth reflect human based values as market based ones or we'll be heading back to the 1800s in terms of life quality for the poorest among us ",2021-03-16 19:00:46.734571

I say thank you Apes  You have led me to to my goal and beyond  Currently sitting at $15000       Now that I have done this I am in GME and I like the stock  I want to do more but I do not know how much I can do beyond my initial contribution  I will hold my 11 shares proudly until Valhalla and hope to walk away from this beautiful chaos up more than I had dreamed       Do I:    a Keep putting any extra cash into GME?    b Search my couch for coins to put into GME?    c Sell my Kidney for more GME?   d Sell my PS5 Purchased from Walmart put it into GME then buy a PS5 from Gamestop when available?,2021-03-16 19:04:27.122286

It makes zero sense to me why any public company wouldn't encourage their employees to own stock  I can say from my own experience that despite logically knowing that my individual work as a sales pion isn't moving the stock price it absolutely helps keep me motivated on the tough days   Plus it encourages the whole team to banter about the greater goals of the company and the more people that care about its future success the greater the potential for these lower-level employees making a tangible difference for the stock    Every single moving piece matters in a company  Awarding stock is a way to SHOW them that they matter not just tell them ,2021-03-16 19:05:29.899983

Decide how much you want to spend and what price you'd like to buy in  If you think whatever the current price per share is is fair then buy then  If your hoping for a dip or a more specific price like say 180 set up a limit order in your stock app and then just wait and see  If it hits your limit order shares will be purchased  Hope that helps!,2021-03-16 19:07:38.733740

If you are making really short term bets I would recommend not timing puts   I think it is much easier to buy calls when the market is down rather than time a reversal let the market come in a couple of %   Keep building up call positions as the market continues to go down and cash in when it recovers ,2021-03-16 19:09:54.270058

Cup and handle patterns require at least a month to form  The handle part takes 2 to 3 trading days or more  Not everything is a pattern  This is the main issue I see with some people doing TA's  If you want to see a real cup and handle pattern zoom out to the daily chart  GME is forming a MASSIVE cup and handle from the January peaks to now and assuming normal time frames we are in the last parts of the handle  The endgame is here ,2021-03-16 19:10:47.482916

Pro tip: it’s all a dip  Some dips are more dippy than others            We’re down from last week and from the all time high           That being said many think that anything less than $300 is a bargain and if this thing goes to the moon anything short of ***then*** ATH will be a bargain    So like the other respondent was saying if you like the stock buy in **at any time**; you can always average down or average up with other dips    Not financial advice I just like the stock ,2021-03-16 19:13:44.113033

The money disappears as they lower the price  Make an excel sheet and pass 10 shares back and forth repetitively lower from $100/s to end with $10/s dropping $5 in value each transaction   10 shares start at $1000 and end at $100 where does the missing $900 go    Balance the book with a $900share purchase  Looks like an anomaly  Nothing wrong with end of day balances on the books  And because there is so many other transactions the $900 purchase barely moves the price    It works in theory but it is too simple I assume something is in place to prevent that sort of thing    Technically spamming the same shares back and forth counts as a sham transaction but I don't know who monitors that   The math checks out though ,2021-03-16 19:15:10.241438

"Normally you would be right but we're talking about hedgefunds needing to cover shorts in a position where they cannot cover all of their shorts but the ones who loaned out their shorts are demanding parts of their shorts back  Let alone that a lot of hedgefunds are still trying to short it as they think 200$ is too high for gamestop  Add in the fact that some people sell at ATH's and buy the dip to pretty much double their assets      All this is what guarantees the rise on Gamestop right now  The only ""risk"" is if all hedgefunds go bankrupt right now ",2021-03-16 19:16:33.960968

Copy and pasting my comment from another thread:  I want to clarify that this **doesn’t** mean that 3 35 Million of *GME* shares were shorted via ETFs!!  Because ETFs' portfolios aren't made 100% out of GME shares only the equivalent of 70 7k GME shares could have been shorted  *NOT 3 35 Million*   See below for how I understand it and to triple check me  *EDIT: Updated with portfolio compositions from March 15th*  If I understand correctly since GME makes up ~~6 75%~~ 12 38% of XRT on March 15th they would have to short about 8 shares of XRT to effectively short 1 share of GME     ETFs Portfolio composition updated with March 15th numbers :  [0 42% of IWM is GME]https://www ishares com/us/products/239710/ Shorting 2 5 Million of IWM shares is equivalent to shorting only 10 5k of GME shares  [12 38% of XRT is GME]https://www ssga com/us/en/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-retail-etf-xrt Shorting 450k of XRT shares is equivalent to shorting only 55 7k of GME shares  [1 12% of IJR is GME]https://screener fidelity com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/portfolioComposition jhtml?symbols=IJR Shorting 400k of IJR shares is equivalent to shorting only 4 5k of GME shares  10 5k + 55 7k + 4 5k = 70 7k,2021-03-16 19:17:24.204897

I agree it also wasn't worth the $4 it was when it was shorted to 145% of the float  No argument there    And yeah retail folks are pumping the stock thinking short sellers will have to close their positions and by doing so further spike it     The problem there is one the float isn't that high and two a lot of us bought calls to protect against ridiculous price spikes    I had a two hour conversation with Fidelity's risk desk as long as I have calls covering the shares I'm shorting it can spike to wherever I'm never getting margin called    Then it becomes a battle of attrition how long can retail traders leave their funds sunk here      And while plenty here will certainly go down with the ship like last time    Last time also proved that the majority aren't willing to ride it into the ground ,2021-03-16 19:17:54.036301

Because it would put a gaping hole in the single bear thesis that holds water: the company’s fundamentals  Arguably it’d be better directed through their revenues because every single dollar will be maximized by the company and you’re not fomoing at $349 and selling at $180 not saying you just giving an example and giving money to shorts  If the fundamentals are immensely better than expectations the short squeeze that would follow would be the only thing that could get the stock anywhere near $100K   Anything that increases their Earnings Per Share would have immense upwards pressure on the share price,2021-03-16 19:21:52.843925

No i don't believe so it's the same pattern as the last few days in which we reach a pain point and shorts price attack down   Closing green today would be a bullish  sign in a down market and to be honest we have had a large run so some profit taking is perhaps responsible      I see nothing thesis breaking in today's action    I did not sell my 3/19 calls though i probably should have shed a few more       Considering our macro momentum is still on the rise quite a few articles have for out saying that we are highly undervalued comparatively to a recent price target of 26?  There is also a few catalystic news of mfg agreement and other things of that note however this could also turn out to not be as good as we hoped      I'm still highly bullish but there is a bear case please see the section in which I say this is far from over    I believe the shorts are fighting for their lives and we're in it for glory  ,2021-03-16 19:22:03.103699

People are always selling shares because they have orders set and there are those attempting to say trade or who otherwise may have paper hands   The volume is not large right now since a lot of people are holding but since there isn’t a lot of buying pressure to keep the prices up high it doesn’t take that much to drop them down  I highly recommend watching a video on how the supply/demand affects the price of a stock for a much clearer explanation than my ape brain could provide ,2021-03-16 19:22:07.103306

saw this quote posted in an entirely different sub but thought it applies to the apes    KEEP HODLING!!!  “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat ”  \-Theodore Roosevelt,2021-03-16 19:30:52.974929

Do you think just stating that you are here to save humanity automatically makes it true? I know there are a lot of fan boys on reddit so I'm sure nothing I say will get through but did you not follow any of the Thailand cave situation?

Everyone thinks JPOW will tank it tomorrow but this has come to be expected   Inversing and buying SPY 3/19 $400c     This might be hella dumb but I also think there's something to Chase and Wells Fargo choosing to delay stimmy delivery until tomorrow   I suspect it's because they know they'll have more customers putting that money straight into their Chase and WF brokerage accounts and they know who will do it and what they will buy based on the previous stimmy deposits   So they've positioned themselves to profit bigly from a stimmy pump tomorrow ,2021-03-16 19:32:53.960016

I’m not necessarily saying those deep ITM call options that were sold were naked however as the stock prices increases more and more call options will be ITM - that would force market makers to purchase up shares in the open market to deliver  Evidently we saw last week when the stock price was approaching $350 +which had huge open interests we saw an immediate pullback followed by a halt  Now you can imagine if the ITM call options exceed the number of float market makers are in deep shit ,2021-03-16 19:34:48.953803

“I was invested in GME at $13 therefore I am smart ” GME at $13 was a good investment - at $200 it is much much harder to argue the same  You can of course argue that it will have a magnificently successful transition to online the fundamentals of its brick and mortar business do not justify the current price  This bet on this transition is in no way a bet on fundamentals it’s a purely speculative play  There is no fundamental metric that currently justifies the price whether you look at revenue gross margin profit cash flows the growth rates of these or just about anything else I’m literally looking at all of these values right now - what do you find tempting? The negative profit margin? The negative sales growth? The way above average in comparison to peers they are not Chewy lol sales multiple?  You’re the one saying “it is just fine and even undervalued at this price point” - you should be the one presenting evidence/projections if anything  I fail to see what role GameStop plays in a world where video game makers go increasingly more straight-to-consumer  There will always be an intermediary for pet food and supplies but why for a video game download?  PS - if you can’t even post the comment in the appropriate thread you might be the dumb money lol,2021-03-16 19:35:10.316698

Do not be afraid if the stocks are going the opposite way you thought they would this week   I got asked earlier why I thought it would go DOWN tomorrow when that is the day that Stimmys come into play and the hearing is also happening    Not to mention on top of that its also on the week that a lot of calls come into play/quadruple witching AND just before the earnings announcement   It must be right? This is the week  Why would it go down???   We all KNOW without a doubt its going to blow through the roof this week  WELL SO DO THE HEDGEFUNDS - and do you not think they are going to do EVERYTHING they can to avoid that? To scare people away make people convinced it isn't going to happen  Convince everyone its a dead stock its still going down etc Its all over      We know this is the week they know THIS too! - and they will fight tooth and nail even if its costs them a fortune its better than the alternative  What better way if people give up because this aligning of all the signs does not come to pass?  They are backed into a corner  Do not underestimate them  They will throw all they can at this       TLDR - Ive made up my mind no matter the movement around the magic 3/19  Hold  0 or Moon ,2021-03-16 19:36:02.252890
i bought a put this morning because i knew this stock would tank it wasn't as bad as i thought so i sold it for $70 profit and bought a call when i saw it going back up    I am pretty happy with the stock price at the moment when i saw AH yesterday and Premarket this morning i was concerned for a steeper drop ,2021-03-16 19:36:02.253083

Nope  Synthetic shouldn’t  be counted because they are supposed to be used for long options positions  But we all know this doesn’t stop use in dilution through washing down and covering not closing positions to get GME taken off security threshold  Another important reason for the 3/19 witching are index and futures options expiry  Congressional meetings are wrapping up  GME ER and announcement by April of their respective leadership positions for plans to turn the company profitable with a business transformation  Short positions have slightly closed  But I’d wager not even conservatively 25-30% have closed  Yes I pulled this number from my ass because it’s likely less ,2021-03-16 19:36:18.819826

Maybe just a case of thinking in line with my confirmation bias but:  It's often quite stagnant in AH is this because they don't bother shorting during those hours as they know a lot of us can't even trade in AH so there are no shares for them to pick up  My broker doesn't even act on buy/sell orders in AH/Premarket if I set a buy/sell order it won't do a thing until the 9:30-16:30 EST market window ,2021-03-16 19:37:07.943839

I’d love to open a restaurant that employs people for reasonable hours at a living wage and if I’m rich enough I would happily lose money for years trying to produce a profitable business model for others to emulate   I’ve worked too many places where the owners are in debt and barely scraping by  Then they have their employees suffer for it by understaffing and underpaying  It’s just so irresponsible to open a business if you can’t afford the risk without your employees taking on some of the burden   Example: If I work more than 18 hours I lose my unemployment benefits for the week  The most they can schedule me for is 24 hours  I can’t survive on 24 hours a week  That’s my problem though so they have me scheduled for 24 hours a week  So I just don’t clock in one shift a week ,2021-03-16 19:37:40.043948

True it would be collectively better if everyone set the same sell price to 500k or whatever  But the DD shows that hedgies will have to buy every bodies shares in the end  Theoretically you could be the last retail investor with GME shares and still ask/get 500k for them   If you want some mathematical perspectives on this there’s plenty of DD on this subreddit that explains this all in a quantitative style,2021-03-16 19:38:51.151728

It'll take a while before XOM restores pre-pandemic cash flows   due to their hedging they probably have been selling the bulk of their production for much lower than current spot price simply because they have to as part of their hedging because they can't count on parabolic prices to continue   i'll bet when oil was languishing at 20 bucks they sold a lot of their future output in the 30's and 40's rather than current spot  They'll trade below pre-pandemic for a while longer until we can see whether the current spot price is sustainable long term ,2021-03-16 19:38:59.788401

Yep but an imbalance in the overall books wouldn't just disappear  There's a lot of ways to do it  But there are also a lot of measures that should prevent it  I've already seen the posts of the order imbalances for buy and sell  You would assume that someone monitors the money side of it too  A net value per share drop would affect the market cap  If there wasn't money movement to adjust the marketcap to match then I would be surprised ,2021-03-16 19:39:03.109946

Well    According to MRQ they have $446 million cash on hand  Max dividend they can pay is $6 3988 or so    Yes the dividend would be paltry compared to the stock value even when maxed out but even issuing one when it is so volatile it would be seen as a catalyst    News of a return to regular dividends  like 0 05% even would send a signal about solvency ,2021-03-16 19:42:14.360681

naked shorting is when you sell a stock that doesn’t exist and plan on buying a real stock in the future to replace it  that means there are “real” gme stocks and “synthetic” gme stocks being traded in the market  the percentage is the percentage of “real” gme stock owned  so the percent of stock in the the market is synthetic+real/real > 100%    institutions owning 115% means shorts have to cover the extra 15% the institutions own plus all the stocks retails own,2021-03-16 19:42:53.792092

Wednesday has historically been a great day to 🚀🌙,2021-03-16 19:45:46.863666
I've said it before and I'll say it again   The day to day means nothing  Look at the perfect cup and handle of the 3m or 1yr chart  This is the most bullish chart I've ever seen  Wall street sees it too that's why big funds and ETF's loaded up on GME last week ARK bought a bunch in preparation for the squeeze   We all read about the $600 million in almost junk bonds by citadel that's just ammo for them to drop the price as much as possible this week and next in hopes that retail investors will panic sell and they can cover enough calls to remain solvent when institutions start calling back their shares ahead of the annual shareholders meeting in June   Just hold for another month and a half and you'll be on the moon or mars when melvin has to come begging for your shares at whatever price you ask for   THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SHAREHOLDERS MEETING IN THE HISTORY OF GAMESTOP  You're a fool if you think the big boys with millions of shares aren't going to call back nearly every single one that melvin and citadel have shorted  They need the votes especially if RC makes plays to set himself up for the CEO position    No GME is not worth $300+ in terms of real value not considering RC and future value potential it's maybe more like $100 or less but what price do you think these guys originally shorted at?  I'll tell you no more than $40 and probably closer to $20 or less  Hell probably a shitload of short interest came up this time last year when Covid hit and short sellers thought GME and the broader retail sector would be killed off entirely  Gme was under $5 at the time    They had the chance to cover everything in February and only lose a few hundred million dollars but they didn't because of hubris  Do you think they're going to cover at $200+? No  They probably won't even cover if it hits $100 because they're greedy  They are going to get fucked in the ass trying to buy back millions of shares at ridiculous prices and they know it ,2021-03-16 19:45:47.975999

I'm talking more about the spac-EV companies with no products and no futures like NKLA HYLN etc than companies like TSLA although I'm sure there are plenty of opinions on them specifically   All NKLA has ever done is outsource some car designs to a third party let a truck roll downhill plough a field and issue dilutive share offerings  Everyone knows this and yet their market cap is still $7b???,2021-03-16 19:45:49.101519

Was encouraged to post this here: If you own MDMA stock you need to vote by tomorrow March 17th to avoid a hostile corporate takeover    &#x200B;  Neos has the **ONLY** legalized version of extended-release MDMA and **3 approved drugs**   *This is a big deal *  Why? Because many publicly traded companies have **0 drugs approved** and have **billions of dollars in market capitalization** how much the company is worth  $NEOS has also created a *proprietary* system called NEORx to distribute it's drugs since they're controlled substances   **3 High potential FDA approved drugs a proprietary delivery system AND it's in a market valued as high as $25 BILLION**  So why has NEOS made a deal to sell itself to Aytu Biosciences where we its current shareholders get ONLY 30% of the future company?  NEOS got a bid from [PDLI in 2018 for $10 25]https://www insidearbitrage com/dealsintheworks/neos-therapeutics-neos-approached-by-pdl-biopharma-pdli/ per share because they understood what big potential there is with this patented XR MDMA drug  Aytu on the otherhand is offering 30 cents  In the ADHD space *drugs with this classification typically are sold for hundreds of millions or billions * Aytu is offering $44 9 million which is literally pennies in this space   Seems crazy that $NEOS management has done this when they could've tried to raise money through the stock market  *Right now itś the best time for micro small cap companies with high potential assets like NEOS to sell stock to investors to grow their companies*  BULL AF! So why are they choosing to give $NEOS away to a lame ass company like Aytu that has NO growth prospects at all  T**his deal is a terrible one for NEOS shareholders  If you own NEOS stock we are getting FUCKED  And if you want MDMA therapy in the future this basically kills XR MDMA being successfully rolled out  It's like watching a unicorn about to get shot and people are voting yes to shooting the unicorn without understanding why that's bad **  Here's how we can fix this from getting shafted:  1  If you own NEOS vote NO YES NO  2  If you don't own NEOS buy a stock  Then you'll get a ballot and you can vote on this merger between NEOS and Aytu   *They use jargon to intentionally confuse people that don't understand how this works people like us that aren't necessarily in finance*  **When they say you agree to this merger aka Aytu stealing NEOS from it's shareholders and giving them an insultingly low deal tell them to go fuck themselves and vote NO **  **When they ask you if you're cool with NEOS doing a reverse split vote YES **  **When they ask if it's cool for NEOS management to keep canvassing to get approval for this terrible merger say FUCK NO **  The point of this is twofold  First by saying NO to these questions you will stop this merger from going through and end up saving a high potential company with valuable useful drugs that many people will be helped by  Second NEOS management is going to be forced to look at alternative to this terrible merger Ex: raising more money through the stock market or shopping the company to someone that will give NEOS shareholders better value for their shares  They've gotten deals in the past turned them down but clearly this time around Aytu is trying to steal this company and it's up to us the shareholders to stop them! We believe in this stock we like this stock there's no other MDMA like it and we are in a time of a therapeutic and pharmaceutical renaissance  Aytu is not as good as they may seem online and they have a history of sucking  SAVE NEOS SAVE MDMA therapy!,2021-03-16 19:48:37.333207

If you have a choice to use any tool to get the answer lots of finance ppl are on jumping on the python or R train  Way easier to do lots of fancy shit it’s repeatable easy to automate and MUCH less prone to errors    Teaching yourself excel is a huge pain I know I’ve done it and most firms worth a damn will drool when you say you have python/R proficiency   Sauce: IT product owner that supported accounting fincance and trading @ large private firm   Vlookup hlookup index match and pivot tables should get you pretty far and if you know a little Visual Basic coding you can look like a badass by doing automation in visual basic for applications and write VBA macros  If you’re gonna learn some programming don’t focus on VBA - python and R is where it’s at   Something I’ve always dropped on anybody I’ve talked to about excel is this formula  It will do a horizontal compare of a1 and b1 and if it matches it will print MATCH MFer! if not no match will appear in the formula cell  Keep in mind data types can mess this up sometimes  Kinda excited to drop this in a public forum bc there’s probably a way easier way to do this and someone will be quick to correct me   =ifiserrormatcha1b10”no match””MATCH MFer!”  Protip run far far away from any company that relies heavily on excel/access for their key processes - ie stuff other than adhoc reporting and prototyping,2021-03-16 19:49:38.216389

For real its a volatility boost could be up down or sideways  If you're leveraged in FDs this could be good  If you sell options for the premium this could also turn out awesome  You can make money in any direction and volatility accelerates this  But it could also melt the market and cost us a lot though I doubt it,2021-03-16 19:50:37.107777

From a technical standpoint all tech stocks are still a very strong buy especially those that defended their 20MA in that drill  Many ran up crazy fast so a breather was in order and historically following corrections this is the exact point is does so  I expect maybe some more sideways for another day or two but with stimmy money entering the market tomorrow I think we resume ripping by the end of the week  Now if JPow goes on and says ‘fuck your stocks’ that thesis is invalidated but I imagine he is aware of how his last talk influenced the market and will be very careful and calculated to resume the pump but I would probably fade me ,2021-03-16 19:51:04.125012

Returning to the gold standard is both literally impossible and also a form of fiat currency   Anyone who believes that moving to a gold backed currency will solve more problems than it creates doesn't understand how currency works  Or how gold works did you know that it's necessary for electronics? Do you understand the effects of the source of value for a currency being a resource required for basically every industry?****  There is about $10 trillion of gold ever dug up  Worldwide  How much is still on the market? How much still is accessible? Impossible to tell   Moving to a gold backed currency will destroy economy of any nation that tried  Even post economic failure it will never be possible for gold to back a currency  Unless society as a whole collapses in some apocalyptic future the amount of people alive and the amount of goods and services that must be exchanged make a gold economy unfeasible ,2021-03-16 19:52:51.694720

Every time somebody decides to sell a position to buy back at a lower price but with more shares they extend their FTD dates!!! I understand we all want more GameStop shares but in this case selling at the peak and buying at the dip is just helping them kick the can down the road even longer  They buy your share and give you a naked one  DO YOU REALLY WANT JUST THE BANANA PEEL OR THE WHOLE BANANA 🍌  KEEP YOUR REAL FUCKING SHARES APES! REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A GAME OF CHESS AND THEY CANT CHECKMATE US BECAUSE WE HAVE TOO MANY KINGS AND QUEENS 💎🙌🏻  simple way to put it  ⬇️⬇️⬇️  Greedy Ape: Hmm I want to have more money when the squeeze kicks off   🤔🤔🤔 *Checks Fintel*  The hedge funds borrowed 1 6Million shares so I predict a dip   *Proceeds to sell at market for profit*  *1 Hour later buys the dip and now has more shares*  now has a few more shares but at what cost my friend 😔 you have fake shares and you are team killing our fellow 🦧🦍 I’ve held since Jan and if your a veteran by now you know citadel has no pants 😳  And remember SPREAD DD the best thing you can do is buy as an individual investor and secondly spread important Due Diligence   Almost forgot to mention my new floor is 2 000 000 paperhanding a few at 1 000 000 sorry guys ,2021-03-16 19:53:54.796542

Is PLUG really a long term play? they are a traditional plugin charge company  I think the future of EV’s should rely upon the accessibility of a quick and sustainable charging system   I’ve researched EV’s and how they can actually have staying power for the future  One solution is Inductive Charging Systems  They are a better solution for commercial and public transport EV’s in the future  I’m not knocking on PLUG as it can maintain a sustainable retail market    But the largest consumer is commercial and they are being held back in acquiring EV’s mostly because of the lack of range and large amount of downtime they currently have   Some good ICS companies out there include: $WATT  $BLNK  $IDEX and others    As always do your own DD and this is not financial advice  I just like the EV industry,2021-03-16 19:54:27.076646

Am I the only one who read/listened to any of DFV's original DD?  Shares must be called in by April 20 in order to vote in the June shareholders meeting  THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MEETING IN THE HISTORY OF GME!!! In the weeks leading up to April 20th we will see unstoppable growth as the shorts transition from tanking the stock to buying whatever they can and trying to bring the price down at the same time of course because their lenders are demanding the borrowed shares back   I could honestly see melvin and citadel calling shenanigans to the SEC and uncle Sam because of how much they're going to lose  They'll claim millions of americans will lose their 401k if they go bankrupt  Which is partly true but we all know the Fed will find a few trillion laying around read: printed on the toilet paper that is fiat currency and bail out the fuckers   Be prepared for more RH bullshit like limiting selling to 5 shares per person and shit like that  There is no doubt in my mind that this will be a bloody battle and retail will not come out on top if we don't time things correctly  Don't get too greedy and,2021-03-16 19:58:57.514330

You ever thought what is the point of living? Think about it you gain stuff through out  life just to lose everything its not like you are progressing towards something  Sure you get to leave a legacy but still in a few years humans will go extinct or the universe will go dark forever  So what was the point of it all? The best way to give meaning to keep your stuff is to live in an endless simulation where you can store your brain and live in your own reality where 1 sec in real life would equal to millions of years in your reality  Only Nvidia can achieve this this is why you should buy Nvidia   Thats my DD,2021-03-16 19:59:13.175598

Because it's impossible to invest in companies that dont operate war profiteering endeavours?  You're mistaken if thats what you're suggesting  I'm simply staying away regardless which direction it goes   There are a million companies out there and not all of them have the same shady past as this company does   So thanks for your suggestion but no I wont be doing that 😂  I know a lot of people dont appreciate being reminded what a company does and how that effects society because all they care about is a dollar   Not everyone operates this way nor do they lose money operating this way ,2021-03-16 20:01:55.088142

The post I read that explained gamma squeezes said the MMs continually buy shares to delta hedge as delta increases  If so then that makes it a momentum play    If it works the way I understand it then that rapid drop last week could have shifted the momentum so now we could be seeing a gamma squeeze in reverse with MMs continually unhedgeding on options  It could make sense since we don’t see a lot of buyers and sellers  But I am retarded so someone please tell me how I’m wrong in a way a retard understands ,2021-03-16 20:03:32.885708

Volatility is the only way you can “get rich quick” but it’s assuredly not the only way to see significant gains in the stock market   For what it’s worth SPY a much less volatile option tracking the S&P 500 has more than tripled in the past 10 years so unless you were making a minimal investment at that time your returns there were likely much more than $1k during those 10 years ,2021-03-16 20:06:50.830397

Remember that after hours volume is so small and is so insignificant on the overall price that most brokerages don't even report it  Don't look at a graph all night and worry about the price going down when there's less than 0 1% of the average volume being exchanged  AH is only interesting when there's a TON of volume out of nowhere either due to FED'S or something happening with a MM or whale ,2021-03-16 20:07:38.406642

Setting deadlines only sets you up for disappointment  This is a fight between longs and shorts mostly institutional investors but our retarded asses are in there too   The shorts will try anything and everything they can  They'll fight as dirty as possible  Why? They're cornered and fighting for survival  Don't expect them to roll over and die   All the longs have to do is HODL  Buying is great but buying ITM or very close to ITM calls is even better   Shorts will have to buy our shares eventually  A catalyst could make that sooner than later but this could take months ,2021-03-16 20:07:40.197228

So we end the day on a bullish uptrend  The price is well above the Volume Weight Adjusted Price VWAP again for the first time since they did that big flash crash on Wednesday the 10th  It's now steadily rising again   I think Shitadel and friends ran out of ammo for the day trying to tank the stock right after the low of the day around 10:30 and the bullish trend picked back up   Closing above 200 today after days of bloodshed is a very good sign ,2021-03-16 20:08:03.023882

If it does trade flat until March 23rd that could be the next catalyst for a huge explosion in stock price  You will have a double whammy of earnings news combined with the drop in IV after earnings - making calls bought after earnings a REALLY TEMPTING thing  I could see a rocket at March 25th ,2021-03-16 20:08:54.137299

It's not the earnings itself but I think that the forward guidance conversation will be interesting  I'm hoping to hear a more concrete vision for the direction of the company  At $200 a share GME is a $14B company right now that did $5B in sales last year  If they demonstrate a path to profitablity and can leverage the billions of dollars worth of free advertising they're getting right now from all of this there's still upside value potential,2021-03-16 20:08:57.003975
Given that a lot of those people just joined the sub within the last month due to GME being in the news probably  Then you factor in that most people are just lurkers here watching the show  Even that 1% is probably high ,2021-03-16 20:08:58.108737

I'm not the best at this  But ill put me in your shoes  I expect price rise $25 to $35 by whatever date  Personally I'd purchase a 30c 33c 35c  The highest value I may sink a week back and try to sell it for premium since that's the highest risk  I also like to grab a put for every week I hold calls as a hedge  Usually they're cheap in that case below profit basis    If the 35 goes very green off the bat sell while theta is low and roll it into a put to hedge your 30c same week  Get it close to the 30 any price between those is where you lose   Look up bullish spreads for gooder info ,2021-03-16 20:09:13.106047

Anybody else in the know and sitting back/relaxing while watching the absolute beauty that hedge funds are pulling off? They are convincing retail buyers that GME is a discount at $188 31  This is literal modern day Mona Lisa - marketing at its finest  If you bought and are holding GME make no mistake you *fell* for it  Millions of dollars are likely being poured in to run all of these opinion bots to influence your actions so don't feel too bad about it when you become one of bagholders at $100+,2021-03-16 20:09:56.876543

While they obviously differ in the exact method of which they acquired wealth the fundamentals are the same; both amassed their riches through the exploitation of others namely the working class  Musk did so in the typical billionaire fashion with underpaid workers shitty worker environments and most famously apartheid  There are many many more examples  Where they can take shortcuts for a profit increase they do so    Another similarity is that they both profited off the COVID-19 pandemic  Musk pushed for Tesla factory workers to be forced to continue work despite the company receiving a large amount of funding from the government during the initial stimulus bill to keep them afloat while workers couldn’t work  Others were furloughed and had their salaries cut  Musk of course also later criticized Congress members for poison pill stimulus bills that put money into corporate pockets conveniently neglecting to mention his role in that  Hypocrisy at its finest    This is in comparison to hedge funds like Melvin that took advantage of the pandemic to short sell the hell out of companies that had grim prospects often resorting to naked shorts which are on paper at least illegal  But we all know that much   While I personally do see the humour in Musk forcing the US government to support his LARPing because it is pretty funny and I 100% would do the same Musk is by no means a person to look up to  It’s cool that at the very least he puts some of his wealth to good use for humanity SpaceX and such but he’s still in the same league as hedge funds and other billionaires  He may pull a Bill Gates and try to make amends later in life but for the time being he is not our friend,2021-03-16 20:10:27.161899

"The cash is the capital    If you have more you can take bigger positions   Remember not all their positions are purchases where you just pay cash  They're required to keep collateral in order to expand to other things    Also keep in mind they aren't just an investment company in fact they primarily are not  They're a FinTech company and also need to just finance their actual activities    They've also done a ton of acquisition might be more of that    In general any company wants as much debt as possible It's usually the lowest cost of capital    Don't think of it as giving up 3% of gains think of it as additional gains they couldn't otherwise get and it costs 3% to do it    So if you could make 11% on an additional 600 Million you'd do it    Again I'll point to literally any other financial company   RBC issued 1 billion Euro in bonds today   they have $137 Billion in Cash  They don't ""need"" another $1 billion  But they'll still benefit from having it means they can invest more lend more whatever",2021-03-16 20:14:10.189918

Why is it grotesque?   It's not like the guy thinks he's the title  Making jokes about what the media says about him is great  What other billionaires do that kind of shit? He's human instead of just money  You're basically saying he's not allowed to be human because he's rich and that right is held only by poor people   That's insane   And you probably wonder why wealthy people often want nothing to do with people who aren't wealthy? This shit  This type of shit right here is why  The negativity for no reason other than because someone is wealthy which is basically the same as negativity due to any other characteristic of a person  I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this ,2021-03-16 20:18:50.191047
He's just generating profit not shorting the stock   He was short stock it is theoretically indefinite until he buys back   Selling a call has a definite end game and is quite different   Of course the WSB is to roll on past $300 anyway so he can lose his money if he wants to ,2021-03-16 20:18:50.869375

That’s what this whole thing has been about  The “something” that can force them will likely be when they run out of liquidity to pay the fee for borrowing their shorted shares this could take ages hence the holding    I BELIEVE not 100% that you were right though and there is indeed a possibility we are holding synthetic shares they aren’t real  But if that’s the case the fault lies with the ones who created these shares and so they are still on the hook to pay us for it    I’m no expert fairly new here  But yeah shit’s fucked and that’s why we’re all here!,2021-03-16 20:19:49.969994

There should be many laws to govern this shit  On one side of the trade you have people buying and holding typical boomer investing and on the other is a group of billionaires doing everything they can to drive stock peices down and bankrupt a company  It really should matter about the motive of buying and holding it's what you do to invest in something  Shorting is profiting on a company failing except they are actively trying to make the company fail    How many games do you know where it's legal to profit of of forcing an outcome?,2021-03-16 20:20:55.932798

>Typically: Put options= short  Call options= long  Why is selling calls that are just above our current price shorting it and cause for backlash?  This is only correct if you look at the buy side  There are two persons involved though: someone is selling those calls  By selling a call you collect a premium and hope your call won't get assigned  If the option expires OTM you make money - the premium  If your call will be assigned the potential risk is unlimited  If you don't own the stock you have to buy it at current market price   Same goes for Puts  By selling a put you are actually bullish on the stock   SO TL;DR:Buying Call Selling Put = BullishSelling Call buying Put = Bearish,2021-03-16 20:21:33.481716

I have looked at your PDF and I still disagree  In general WSB isnt doing market manipulation with GME because WSB it's not a collective organised group and manipulation is against WSB policy should be reported    If someone here was sending out emails and paying for ads to do specific things then yes that is manipulation and is banned from WSB  Posting an opinion on a PUBLIC forum is not market manipulation  Telling someone to buy and hold isnt market manipulation that is a core feature of investing - everyone should be doing that   Even posts explaining why options can cause gamma squeeze isnt market manipulation    Majority of posts here dont have specific steps to take but would fall under opinion and most the DD could be in a finance paper    Does the odd user attempt market manipulation? Sure- as above literally anyone in the world can post here  A 12 yo kid could be telling people to hail DFV and all buy options on Thursday to trigger gamma  Plotkins himself could be posting here trying to manipulate in his favour   Theses posts should be reported as they go against WSB policy  Naturally an open public forum will have people attempting all sorts of things ,2021-03-16 20:22:08.043217

It doesn’t really work that way   Options pricing isn’t a result of IV it’s the other way around     If you want to see for yourself find a very illiquid options chain no open interest no one is trading it you could put out an ask price under the current one and the IV changes accordingly    The people/market trading options and what they are willing to pay for any particular contract determines the price of that contract  IV is derived from that price   Generally speaking more volatile stocks have higher IVs but the IV is not derived directly from the actual volatility of the stock ,2021-03-16 20:22:12.993984

There's a nonstop steady stream of buying  Volume only climbs when shorts attack  Once they end their attack you can see the constant buying unobstructed again ,2021-03-16 20:22:18.213851
I teach and train salespeople  Part of what I preach is sanity in sales or how not to self destruct  There's also a good course on how not to fuck yourself and how to unfuck yourself   ,2021-03-16 20:22:18.829762

"Aside from ""I like the stock  Diamond hands!"" talk  What is the point of buying GME at $180? What's stopping this from coming back down to earth at $20 per share? Not trying to be a FUDster but I really have no idea why and am not convinced this is a good investment  Change my mind ",2021-03-16 20:22:19.941407

RGB is really meant to just be so you can pick you favorite color and stick with it   But then in the marketing imagery it's always full of rainbows and wild effects just to show that it can do any color and that the LEDs are addressable  Then the default settings are an example rainbow usually    Those two things make people think that's what you're supposed to do with it  I don't care about RGB at all but most high end products have it anyway so pretty much all my parts are filled with addressable LEDs  I just set them all to a static color I like and leave it at that ,2021-03-16 20:22:23.102549
