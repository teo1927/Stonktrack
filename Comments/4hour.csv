A stock's value will naturally decay if no one is buying  No one needs to sell for that to happen  If somehow WSB apes owned 100% of the stock and everyone held the stock would maintain it's last price  But if almost everyone is holding but a few are selling just a small few and no one is buying at that price the price will drop    We are fast approaching the point where so much of the float is owned by retail that shorts can barely make a dent because they can't get shares  A big stimmy buy in this week would be just what we need  Expect another negative day tomorrow  Wednesday is full of potential   The low buy in point will hit tomorrow  There is a good chance to drop under $200 which would be an awesome dip to buy ,2021-03-15 21:57:27.961191

This is probably accurate    Honestly the best thing for this stock in terms of an outcome would be for it to become a stable for a couple of months  Give option prices time to cool down and let that big wave of April puts expire   Disappointing for those who yolo into $800 calls but ~~revenge~~ investing is a long game ,2021-03-15 21:58:29.154616

When you hedge though you also need more significant movement on your positions to gain  Like if you bought a $400 call for $5 and a $400 put for $5 you now need it to move more than $10 in each direction to break even  You also need twice the amount of money to trade with  With buying only 1 you just need it too move $5 in your direction to break even   If I personally thought the stock was going up from $400 to $410 instead of hedging my trade I would just buy 2 $400 calls  That way when it hits $410 instead of breaking even I am up 100%    If I didn't know if it was going to go up to $410 or down to $390 I would just stay away from it all together lol,2021-03-15 22:03:33.056217

GME is the only stock in history to be shorted over 100%  AMC is shorted high as well but not even close to GME  As we get closer to the squeeze hedge funds don't have the resources to split between AMC and GME anymore they only can focus on attacking GME  I'd say this is truly the sign that we are nearing super close to the squeeze  The hedge funds are back to the wall so much they have to now choose between which is the more dangerous loss which obviously is GME ,2021-03-15 22:03:43.176306

Ok you understand tesla now it's roughly $700   So if you could buy Tesla at $7 that would be a massive discount right? Now if you could buy Tesla at $50 it suddenly wouldn't be a massive discount?  Smaller than before yes but in the grand scheme of things still a huge one ,2021-03-15 22:04:04.988516

You’re literally making no sense     do you think you got it back free and clear ? Do you think that the tax increases in the coming years to make up for the trillions spent in these 3 bills won’t “steal” more of your money ?   Go fuck yourself you broke bitch only cry babies making hourly complain about how taxes are “their money” for those of us living outside of poverty they are at worst an inconvenience and at best a way to keep idiots like you out of my zip code hahahah,2021-03-15 22:04:07.119932

Don't really understand the GME hate here  Yes lots of us retards are super bullish on it let us be  Remember when you laughed and pointed at us when it crashed back to 40? It's up 5x since then  What on earth makes you think this play is over? Have you read at least 1 of the numerous DDs?   Really just stop wasting your time  GME is the only realistic play here  No other fucking stock at this moment in time deserves the same amount of bullishness as GME  Not RKT not AMC not SNDL none of those stocks  If you like them then more power to you and I hope your gains are great but do not in anyway compare it to GME ,2021-03-15 22:04:14.042481

Thanks  I think what throws me off is everything I read says call options gives you the option to buy 100 shares at strike price $110 with premium  So I understand if said premium is $4 per 100 shares which is $40  Do I still pay the $110 per stock plus the $40 premium? Which would be $11040? Also do I have to buy all 100 stocks or can I exercise it for say 5 stocks? Also if you do a call and don't exercise it do you just pay the premium?,2021-03-15 22:05:23.764252

I believe that retail started this whole thing but institutional money got on board to make it truly happen  I don't see any way possible that retail drove that bus to $346 ish    that was serious cash not our pennies   I do agree that to get retail pumped up and into it there has to be a tweet a surge a something because well sadly most of these folks don't get it at all  They have an attention span of a gold fish   They're getting punked by the pump and dump AMC bullshit  Just like RKT and SLV   To make my point think about what AMC has to offer versus AMC  AMC is simply a movie theater chain and they will be nothing more than that ever  They can't sell dvd movies no one wants them  They can't stream them that ship has sailed long ago  Netflix anyone? They are simply a movie theater  Sure if they can get the suckers to pay even MORE for their Coke and Popcorn they might add a few dollars to their value  But other than a Hollywood Blockbuster showing up it's a movie theater  It's going nowhere  I honestly don't understand the hype   Conversely GameStop has unlimited upside potential  Partner with Tesla for in car gaming gaming chairs as an option for those long road trips  Online gaming tournaments year round culminating in a PPV and live arena championship with Draft Kings as the exclusive partner for wagering  All GameStop does is take a percentage  Rinse and repeat    CLEARLY GameStop is the play  Whether this ridiculous short squeeze comes to fruition or not as a long term play GME is solid ,2021-03-15 22:09:47.105751

I believe that retail started this whole thing but institutional money got on board to make it truly happen  I don't see any way possible that retail drove that bus to $346 ish    that was serious cash not our pennies   I do agree that to get retail pumped up and into it there has to be a tweet a surge a something because well sadly most of these folks don't get it at all  They have an attention span of a gold fish   They're getting punked by the pump and dump AMC bullshit  Just like RKT and SLV   To make my point think about what AMC has to offer versus AMC  AMC is simply a movie theater chain and they will be nothing more than that ever  They can't sell dvd movies no one wants them  They can't stream them that ship has sailed long ago  Netflix anyone? They are simply a movie theater  Sure if they can get the suckers to pay even MORE for their Coke and Popcorn they might add a few dollars to their value  But other than a Hollywood Blockbuster showing up it's a movie theater  It's going nowhere  I honestly don't understand the hype   Conversely GameStop has unlimited upside potential  Partner with Tesla for in car gaming gaming chairs as an option for those long road trips  Online gaming tournaments year round culminating in a PPV and live arena championship with Draft Kings as the exclusive partner for wagering  All GameStop does is take a percentage  Rinse and repeat    CLEARLY GameStop is the play  Whether this ridiculous short squeeze comes to fruition or not as a long term play GME is solid ,2021-03-15 22:09:47.786808

Pdt looks bad but there is really no reason to daytrade or profitability in it with under $25k unless options but those are t+1 in a cash account If you cant work ur way up to 25k with long dated plays then daytrading would have eaten you alive anyway   GFV doesnt just apply to the poors so I dont see the argument there ,2021-03-15 22:11:03.066910

I don't follow you on that people owning shares doesn't mean they can't borrow against them at least 50% is still in institutional hands so there's no shortage there    and if you've got 45 million shares trading a day there's no liquidity type issue       The borrowing fees are pretty reasonable so again no signs there's some shortage      Remember this was originally short 140% now even if it is 51% that's way down but most sources seem to point to 21 to 30%       6 8 is a DEVASTATING hit for a Hedge fund 90% of them would be bankrupt outright from a $6 8 billion hit      I don't understand the obsession with hedge funds though the largest hedge fund in the world is only like $75 billion and most are much smaller  I'd be much more concerned at this point about Banks and Asset Managers taking short positions       Like Yay people nearly bankrupted like a $10 billion hedge fund no one had ever heard of we're all heroes  In the mean time the 3 largest GME holders manage a collective $19 trillion and it made them a few billion       Imagine if State Street or someone that size decides to just take a 10000000 share short position at $300 hedges it with 800 Calls then chills     What could make them move? If the price goes to $800 they just need to post the difference and it goes any higher doesn't hurt them because the calls cap them     As long as they have $5 billion in collateral which obviously they do they could hold that position as long as they like       The whole short squeeze concept really only works when they're losing money haven't hedged and can't afford to hold it  I think the players still in this don't suffer from those issues ,2021-03-15 22:13:20.879135

"Sorry you're being downvoted  It's just mob mentality  Also what you said is kinda dumb too being that ""GME should only go up"" like we're pretending hedge funds are going to just sit and let us take billions from them   &#x200B;  I believe GME is down today because we are getting extremely close to the squeeze  The biggest indicator being that AMC is up today and GME is down  Hedge funds have shorted both GME and AMC and their price has mirrored for the past 2 months  Why all of a sudden did they stop mirroring?  It's because hedge funds are at the point where they have to choose between which stock is more dangerous  GME is the only stock shorted over 100% in history so obviously GME poses a greater threat  Hedge funds can no longer afford to attack both GME and AMC  Their entire focus is on GME now and this is likely the final battle  We either stay strong and hold or people get scared and move to AMC or just sell  Which would play out perfectly for hedge funds  Not financial advice  Good luck!",2021-03-15 22:15:22.082777

Is that the pattern that brought it back down to around $40?  I didn't have any spare cash when it happened and I'm hoping to pick some up at $40 if it happens again  Even if GME don't moon I'm sure it'll go back up to at least $100 in the long term if not sooner and 150% profit isn't something to turn down ,2021-03-15 22:15:25.856739

I think they are redesigning it soon personally I like E*TRADE They def have one of the best interfaces amongst brokerages similar to them although it could be better,2021-03-15 22:16:31.832719
I actually was a shareholder for a long time leading into the first rally  As it ran up I sold covered calls as a way to feel less bad about selling it because essentially I was able to account for some FOMO   For example: the price ran up to $100 and I wanted to sell I sold long dated calls near the money so I'd get some fat premium and essentially be selling my shares for more  So when it ran up more it wasn't as bad of FOMO  Basically meant I got to profit off of some of the rally that happened after I sold   The other unique upshot is it allowed me to go Delta neutral and effectively close my exposure with some deeper ITM calls $50 strikes while still holding some of my stock that was almost one year old  That allowed me to capture the gain stock as long term capital gains and harvest the loss short calls as a short term loss  For tax reasons this was a nice perk    I have been closing out my stock as it turned LT and would sell rallies and essentially get slightly short by holding less and less stock against the -100 from the short call   I actually closed my last 100 shares in this rally and kept my last short $50 call open  I think it's probably a smart call to sell some CCs even all the convoluted stuff I mentioned aside  Vol is so sooo high on these rallies that it's really like getting paid to participate and all you have to do is accept that if it goes up a stupid massive percent your gains are capped    Tldr; there ain't much I haven't done with GME in the last couple months ,2021-03-15 22:16:31.832865

For the short term you are right  It is still a dying business model in the long run as it is a luxury service thats replaced with cheaper options the ease of access to content to cheap big tv to cheaper food  15 years ago I would go to theaters regularly   I probably went 2-3 times in 5 years maybe less     People will go out a lot for a while but unless there are any changes i think the demand is slowly dying    Maybe reducing size to adapt to the demand could be more suitable and I dont think I can justify the 20$ price tag after 1 year of massive losses with any other news than theaters opening again and having short term potential    But based on the hype and support it got you can be right and get some profits  But suggesting to sell other stock to buy in when it already recovered quite a lot seems like working for your own interests ,2021-03-15 22:18:30.292333

More volume is needed tho     Maybe its just me but if WSB attention is too divided on AMC/GME split I have no position there make your money AMC holders!  Ape no attack Ape  GME 10 x3/19c @ 200 the HF WILL conquer us by pitting AMC against GME each other    Seeing gains in AMC?  You CANNOT sell your GME to chase it!  Sell your car sell your children sell your wife and her boyfriend     Seeing insane run-ups in GME and want to catch the rocket?  HOLD THAT AMC YOU PAPER HANDED BITCH!  Set up your portfolio all you want you smooth-brained apes but we MUST 💎🙌 and cannot go chasing whatever is running up 10% on any given day if we want the moon  🚀,2021-03-15 22:23:00.985291

I think the pullback a couple weeks ago will keep us neutral to bullish over the next month or two  If things actually open back up completely that’ll bring a big surge from consumer confidence and spending  But then a bigger correction at the end of that  Obv I have no damn clue lol but I think we’ll be okay for a bit  I’ll start hedging more and more as we go ,2021-03-15 22:23:10.586709

Correct me if I'm wrong because I'm autist    but going long on AMC isn't really leaning on a potential squeeze but instead liking the stock and seeing the potential for growth  The squeeze would just be an added benefit if you want to make some quick cash in and out then back in long  Idk just my thoughts,2021-03-15 22:25:15.843047

Let's say that there really is a risk of a Big crash or finnancial crisis  Do you think that even if it's what should happen Government and authorities would let it happen?  Maybe the final end of all this is something like the Government SEC etc intervenes saves HFs asses because not doing so would crash the whole system this will obviously fuck us the small retail investors but it's a price authorities would pay in order to avoid mayhem  At the same time Government passes new laws to prevent this from happening ever again   If that's the picture we are dealing with right now then GME have or will become just a pump and dump and whales are using it to profit from volatility   I don't know what yo think atm but I'll hold for the moment ,2021-03-15 22:25:50.070424

I know you said it's an over simplification so I thought I'd just clarify something for people   You will often see the OBV go up on red volume because OBV is not calculated based on the color of the volume   It is calculated based on the candles closing price   If the price of the stock closes higher than the previous close then the volume is added to the OBV   If the stock closes lower than the previous close then it is subtracted from the OBV    I learned OBV the same way OP is teaching it and it always confused me to see OBV higher on red days ,2021-03-15 22:26:15.125493
Yeah I’m not worried about that   Kind of like that whole “cut off your nose to spite your face” thing     What is the purpose of saving/investing your money?  For me it’s so I can stop going to work as soon as fucking possible   If part of that equation is giving a piece of the pie away so be it   If I had plans of working until I could draw social security no fucking way I would be saving money now  I’d be buying boats and shit now  Why save money invest it while simultaneously planning to work until you get paid to do nothing to live comfortably for the last 10 years of your life    You can live comfortably anyway by the time your 65 years old just from social security assuming you pay off a home in the mean time   Medicare is free   All you need money for is eating and fucking off and they give you money for that   BUT if you wanna start fucking off for a living before you’re 65 it’s gonna take some money    which is why I save/invest ,2021-03-15 22:26:15.125653

Why will some of you will never learn? The first income tax passed in 1913 was supposed to hit only the top 1% at a rate of 1%   Now we throw half of the national income into a hole  Only God knows what this costs us in terms of lost productivity    Given that we just spent $6 trillion we don’t have in the last calendar year as a result of stupid policies taxation and spending are obviously completely unrelated now   That means that the only reason to tax is to promote the politics of envy and to punish selected groups  This does not go well ,2021-03-15 22:27:39.842203

Yeah of course   &#x200B;  T2DM is becoming more common and T1DM management isn't changing anytime soon so the need for easy-to-use and readily available tech is there  Their Eversense is looking to be a long-term CGM which could be extremely desirable among patients      But yeah like I said still pretty big risk ,2021-03-15 22:28:02.075106

Well I thought I was getting a steel at the first dip  Got in with some more shares at 226  Then they slap me in the butthole with an even better buy at 217  Averaged down and got myself even more discounted shares  See you in the 270s tomorrow and right back down to the 220 dips  How are more people not buying into this thing yet? It’s literally free money  It’s almost comical at this point how predictable the dips and spikes are and again idk how there aren’t more people buying literally shares of free money ,2021-03-15 22:28:02.075346

Yea but I'm not asking what you believe I'm asking why you believe it    What makes you think the didn't cover the shorts? We know at least 80 million shares got covered somehow    what makes you think the remaining positions are mostly old ones?  I think you keep kind of lumping it together as if this is one big firm that lost money    If someone new came in and shorted at $300 it doesn't make any difference at all to them if some other different company lost money earlier   They don't care about someone else's initial position ,2021-03-15 22:29:48.930305

What the fuck are you talking about ? “If we want our money” the government isn’t a fucking bank and that’s not our money being handed out it’s literally just national debt piled on     you’re saying you want back the money they stole from you but you just took a $1400 payment as a rebate on $6000 or better that they haven’t even stolen from you yet you fucking idiot  Do the math on the avg tax payers burden for these spending bills    Do you remover when a certain orange man wanted to build a Great Wall of America like some kind of cartoon character ? How much was the spending ? $50b? $100b? And they couldn’t stop talking about how our grandkids would have to pay off that spending      so who will pay off the 50x walls worth of stimulus spending we’ve done in the last year ?,2021-03-15 22:31:06.425485

I think we need to explain to people that a significant event will begin March 19th but it is NOT the squeeze   Here's the facts: The 3rd Friday of every month is traditionally the day options expired when options trading first started  Now it's weekly   Going back to September the week following the 3rd Friday has been a high performance week in September to December 2020  In January and February this is true as well but WEDNESDAY following the 3rd Friday of the month was when the price shot up to $450 in Jan and form $40 to $91 $200 after hours in February   We have been battling the hedges hardcore these last few weeks  It will continue for months  It will not end soon   March 19th is NOT the squeeze  March 19th is a catalyst - IMHO Not a Financial Advisor - that will open next week up  Next week we will see HUGE numbers and it will be exciting  That will STILL not be the squeeze  We might have to wait even until the Wednesday following the 3rd Friday of April for meaningful gains  We might be faced with short attacks that bring us down from those highs  Again STILL NOT THE SQUEEZE   Everyone buckle up enjoy the ride and don't think about dates too much  However there is a trend of the week following the 3rd Friday being a repetitive week of gains for the last six months   I think the hard part is almost over but I do not think the battle is soon over  Leaving the Earth's gravity is a feat that took tens of thousands of years of human evolution to achieve   And you know something    An Ape went to space before Humans did    His name was Albert      EDIT:  **Ham the Astrochimp ** Albert was a Reeses Pieces Monkey,2021-03-15 22:35:15.927604

Some how a lot of hedges covered and other hedges picked up new shorts when we ran over 350+  Robinhood fucked us all and we dropped back down  Imagine the short squeeze to be at the top of a very tall ladder  Each step of the ladder is a gamma squeeze  There’s a step at 50 100 150 200 etc you can verify this by checking the concentration of open interest at these nice psychological numbers  When we ran up the first time we built each step on the ladder one by one each day new strike prices were generated and each day we reached them  On the way down we broke most of the steps on the ladder except 800 check open interest for 800  Now we started climbing again and built our steps up to just below 350 we got smacked down to the mid 200s and now we ran out of materials to build more steps  That’s why my OP is asking for people to invest in 250-325 calls to rebuild the steps  It takes way too much resources/capital to jump to 800+ without the steps on the ladder   Hope that makes more sense,2021-03-15 22:36:04.021560

People think shorted stock needs to be recovered and returned to their owners  The problem lay in their hypothesis because the first run in January probably did catch a few HF by the balls Melvin but most can afford the interest rates on borrowed shares and count on prices descending  By the way while they do that they will short the stock at the top as well knowing they'll make enough to offset borrowed interest rates  Once all yall lose your shirts or attention they'll buy up stock at discount to close positions or most probably did and took a small hit small to them  Stocks increase like any other commodity  Supply and demand  If you hold forever the pool of shares to sell become smaller if no one is buying at those prices it'll come down until the price meets someone's offer   What's keeping it afloat is these Johnny come latelies buying shares at stupid high prices but they're running out of cash  They're also wasting it on way OTM calls that MM don't need to cover so once they all expire on Friday the closer OTM stocks they don't need any longer and just dump those millions of shares on the market and make their money  That will also bring the price down unless people keep buying either the shares or closer to ITM calls   There's no short squeeze or ladder short attack nonsense  There's gamma pressure and that's releasing Friday and the Friday after  By all means keep holding  I need the price to go way up so someone exercises my calls or drop to bottom so I can buy then back and dump GME the next time yall do this  This limbo shit sucks as I can't put my money to work in other stocks,2021-03-15 22:37:00.655642

There is a strange way of pulling early but you have to commit to pulling a set amount per year once a year for 5 years rain or shine and I think it's only what you've contributed not what you're earned   Also there are brokerage rules with IRA accounts like Fidelity won't let you have margin at all which restricts a number of options strategies or get enabled for pattern day trader rules   TD Ameritrade allows limited margin on IRA accounts   Read up carefully as with any other tax situation ,2021-03-15 22:47:59.233929

Even if **DTCC** didn't screw you the stock would have had a brief though larger spike and then would have crashed back down     It isn't going to maintain these prices unless the business fundamentals get better     That doesn't mean that it won't spike again; however it was solely due to irrational investor behavior and not because of fundamentals      Using a prior irrational number to justify a future irrational number is pretty far from a sure bet ,2021-03-15 22:51:42.836271

I totally figured that this was going to be some kind of Japanese horror film  Bunch of people kidnapped told to lay down and be exposed to a bunch of environmental tortures  They have to hold hands if they let go they and the person they let go from both are killed  If one gets up they're all killed   They have no way of knowing when *or if* they'll ever be free  All they know is they don't want to die or cause the others around them to die ,2021-03-15 22:53:05.078888

My grandma bought me one share of DIS in 1997  Split into 3 a year later  Just got into trading this year  Trying to convert this old paper stock which is godknowswhere to something actually useful digital has been the most useless boomer thing I've ever dealt with  Phone calls mailing letters    Meanwhile the share price is just teasing me  I just know it's gonna drop the minute I get these things digitized ,2021-03-15 22:53:05.715381

Really considering AMC LEAP puts at some point  I think AMC could continue to climb this year with continued good news and with the knuckle dragging strength of stimmy packing ass monkeys but at some point 2023 puts feel like free money  AMC was trading $6-$7 pre-pandemic before they lost 4 6 billion so it’ll come down eventually    Also prolly will get CNK calls at some point to get in on they movie reopening action  Cinemark was trading $32 pre-pandemic so has more room to run safely  So I guess CNK monthly calls rolled into AMC 2023 puts is what I’m thinking ,2021-03-15 22:53:07.852238

You know I was contemplating the enormous amount of Good we were able to do through adopting Apes and other endangered species this past weekend  With over 9 million members we could donate small amounts of 1-5 bucks to a specific charity every weekend and make a world of difference to a huge amount of people around the world    Maybe a mod could set up a way for us to select a charity to target for this coming weekend  If the greedy ass holes holding all the money won’t help maybe us poor retarded apes can with a little portion of the tendies we’re taking back from evil hedges    Let’s shoot for any charity as long as it’s honest and does good work  Let’s change the world one crayon at a time!,2021-03-15 22:57:25.909896

Roughly speaking the existence of options means someone has to be ready to deliver them if they're excercised   While there's a ton of options out there more of the stock is tied up by market makers who can't sell it  That means less volume read: stim check apes have more of a bouying impact on the price and importantly that large glut of reserve stocks backing the options won't be dumped until Monday    Unless option activity following the 19th goes up significantly *in theory* those MMs will dump all the stock from the OTM calls that expired next Monday ,2021-03-15 23:00:22.101482

Typically you are correct   However there were a few points where hedge funds had to mass liquidate other holdings to either cover their position or provide the maintenance cost   There is a reason that spy directly inversed GME for awhile there,2021-03-15 23:01:33.027245

That’s what High Frequency trading does they trade thousands of shares a second exploiting fractions of cents in share price and currency value discrepancies across multiple markets   You cannot compete literally impossible to compete with their dedicated fibre optic cables running across the Atlantic  Good news is that you don’t need to worry about looking for price discrepancies because HFT will have already equalised them and you get high speed internet from the fancy new undersea cables they fund ,2021-03-15 23:01:37.103033

Before acceptance there was a lot of reasoning   Maybe it will shoot back up soon   Maybe i can sell the next spike and not be at such a loss   Maybe i should have bought in later   Eventually you just accept the money is gone and move on with the slight hope it will shoot up,2021-03-15 23:01:56.319428
I bought some today   I think it's a good gamble on getting government contracts   Biden wants to replace the Federal fleet cars with electric and this is a plant in a Swing State with union workers -- several positives there   Tesla is pricey and in a Red State now so I don't see them getting the contracts from a Dem controlled government ,2021-03-15 23:01:56.319528

If you think a stock price going down while you own it means you've lost money you're wrong   When you invest in a stock expect the price that you paid to be a reference point  The price can drop below above it shouldn't matter until you sell  You're talking about unrealized losses which are different from losing money,2021-03-15 23:01:58.470988

It was horrible! And weirdly misogynistic for a movie that was supposed to be about princesses having equal right to rule as their male counterparts    I was just so confused about the way they were treating the warlord’s daughter- at first I thought she was going to be a villainess as a foil for the crown princess  An example of a woman who grew up in an oppressive society and used those cultural norms and expectations to seize power a la Empress Wu  Her first scene really had some “secretly plotting to kill you and seize power vibes    But then they just decided to do the plot from the first movie again and have her be a blank piece of paper?  That plot is incredibly offensive for 2021  Especially since the movie implies that she’s scared of her warlord father hence her hesitation to do anything that would piss off the man the warlord has arranged for her to marry  And the movie has the crown prince give a speech about how horrible she is!   There were other weird misogynistic plot points toowhy did the crown princess have to literally physically beat a challenger to the throne to convince her dad that she is capable of rule? The movie had kept bringing up trade routes-I thought she was going to pull some slick political move but NOPE ITS STICK BEATING TIME,2021-03-15 23:02:04.901951

It’s not yours and it wasn’t stolen   Property rights only exist under US law  Nothing is yours unless the law says it is   The authority that makes money “yours” is the same authority that can collect taxes   FURTHERMORE employer wage and salary rates are determined with taxation as a factor so you would likely earn a lower wage/salary if there was no taxation   Any way I agree people can do whatever they want with it it’s just feels extra dumb to see someone cry about taxation being theft ,2021-03-15 23:03:28.814572

It’s not yours and it wasn’t stolen   Property rights only exist under US law  Nothing is yours unless the law says it is   The authority that makes money “yours” is the same authority that can collect taxes   FURTHERMORE employer wage and salary rates are determined with taxation as a factor so you would likely earn a lower wage/salary if there was no taxation   Any way I agree people can do whatever they want with it it’s just feels extra dumb to see someone cry about taxation being theft ,2021-03-15 23:03:29.870813

I can appreciate your thought on trying to increase your share count just remember there is a lot of counterfeit shares out there and if you happen to have any it would be a shame to have it bought back by a HF  To me those shares are so much more valuable  It’s unchArted territory with all the FTD  I don’t even think it was a massive issue like it is now in the first GME squeeze  Correct me if I’m wrong,2021-03-15 23:05:03.070928

We are the captain now   We own most if not all of the float of real shares   We're holding   They are using options to create synthetic shares to short and covering with WAY OTM options  remember $4000000 put guy last week? Remember all the $800c's?  When the float is completely owned by other parties that won't sell there is no legit way to short the stock  Then options interest becomes the only way to move the stock because MM's need to hedge ,2021-03-15 23:06:01.842275

This is one of the arguments for a universal basic income - ie a monthly stimulus check  The people that really need it will spend it and it’ll go back into the economy where the rich will get richer and then get taxed on it so you can do it all over again and again   It’s a nice circular flow that lets everyone be better off    What‘a more is that when people are getting at least their basic needs met crime goes down and health care costs go down so taxpayers save on the back end ,2021-03-15 23:06:14.074625

Literally so disgusting  Just go offer to suck the nearest cop to you off since you love the state so much  Property law is protected by violence or the threat of it  The state is currently the wielder of the violence  Do you think they are the only ones that can retard? Who REALLY owns your land in the current system you or the state?  No your wages are decided with taxation as a factor because you're a poorfag lol  Not mine   Taxation is theft through and through  You're a retard if you can't see that as fact  It isn't an argument ,2021-03-15 23:08:16.602533
A split would work in reverse so in my case id owe 1000 shares rather than 500   However on split the price would fall so generally you'd end up near some equilibrium point   I assume the short basis adjusts as well   For a split GME would have to announce 10 days in advance its not like they can just drop it on people   I think that's plenty of time for folks to close their positions or further hedge with long calls    The reality here is GME isn't worth 250 a share its debatable whether its worth 40$ a share  And sure everyone who has bought shares can hold indefinitely but in that scenario the price still drops its not like there's a ton of new buyers showing up to to bag hold until the grave    Right now the float isnt high enough and if these folks shorted near the 300$ mark well you've got a lot of ground to cover to force a margin call on them under those circumstances assuming they didnt do what I did and buy long calls to limit losses on the short position and margin calls which seems like a no brainier ,2021-03-15 23:08:16.602616

put contracts are basically the reverse and give you the right to sell 100 shares at a specified price strike price    so these are just instruments that do what they do and people use them in different ways  Apes and retards use them to make insane bets that either burn their cash or explode into generational wealth    A more conventional use would be to use them as a sort of insurance policy  If you are sitting on 1000 TSLA shares back when it hig $800 that is an $800000 investment  Now let's say you get nervous that the price will tank but you don't want to ditch your shares  You might buy a $700 put contract  You pay for the contract similar to premiums when you buy insurance but then if TSLA tanks to $500 you still get to sell your shares at $700 so you paid a premium to limit your potential losses    FYI: there is a lot more to learn about options before burning cash on them  You can bet a stonk will go up buy a call be correct but still lose money e g  if volatility was high when you bought it and then goes down ,2021-03-15 23:12:33.130921

I was in at $28 and swing traded it all the way up to $130 probably when it hit $80 I decided to hold long  Then obviously the short report hit and I was watching it tank and decided to get out around $80  Eventually bought back around $60 and I’ve averaged down a little  I really love this company there’s huge upside  I was so pissed when that short report came out  For a stock to go from $130 to $38 in a day or two is wild,2021-03-15 23:13:59.775922

"My favorite is the story of Trevor Milton   It all began with a stock named NKLA a hydrogen truck maker that went public through a SPAC  Hype was built on WSB and 14$ options payed out 10 baggers  Hydrogen trucks would compete with TSLA a factory has been under construction for a while and soon things will ramp up   Millionaires made over night on this stock  It kept rising and rising till it was worth more than legacy auto makers and all was well   But disaster struck **citron did a short report**  In it they discovered horrific truths  - Trevor Milton's truck didn't exist  It was a prop he pushed down a hill and recorded to make investors believe the truck actually drove   - The ""tech"" he claimed to have didn't exist   - The ""factory"" being built didn't exist the field was empty and the ground wasn't even broken   - Worse Trevor Milton was exposed as a prolific scam artist who did similar scams before   - Because of this the SEC opened an investigation into NKLA and Trevor   NKLA stock drilled but WSB rejoiced  It thought it found a unicorn everyone could buy puts and be rich on a stock that should be worthless! An infinite money cheat!  People loaded up on puts EOD and waited for tendies ton show   But they did not show NKLA kept going up  It went up and up for weeks and any drills were temporary  It had been pumped by traders who were also buying Hertz stock   WSB was caught in a YOLO that made sense too much sense for the 2020 covid market  NKLA was seen as a ""discount value stock"" and that Citron were liars and the SEC would find nothing   WSB got worn down over time and forced to exit their positions   And that is how WSB lost to a scam artist who built a Fred Flintstone truck ",2021-03-15 23:14:13.413111

Buy PLTR  It’s a Tesla situation  Hype has died but when people actually understand what they do and how valuable their software is ppl will pile in hard  I bought Tesla sub 200 pre split  Innovative value plays only  I went big on Palantir and will continue to buy  In Peter thiels book he mentioned that he was working in a business that will monopolize an entire industry that doesn’t exist yet  The business was Palantir  The industry was telling the future with simulations  No competition  They are completely industry agnostic and applicable to all business  They even saved BP over a billion dollars for a cost of less than 100 mill  That is value in software ,2021-03-15 23:14:19.410783

"You should do some more studying but the basic principle is this:  If there are more people trying to buy than sell the buyers have to buy shares at the ask  Thus they're eating away at the ask side which increases the price   If there are more people trying to sell they're having to eat away at bids in order to continue selling which lowers the price   If it were as simple as ""volume always has two sides"" the price of every stock would never change  The key is which side bid or ask is initiating more trades ",2021-03-15 23:14:42.521736

"Copy of the Milton story:  It all began with a stock named NKLA a hydrogen truck maker that went public through a SPAC  Hype was built on WSB and 14$ options payed out 10 baggers  Hydrogen trucks would compete with TSLA a factory has been under construction for a while and soon things will ramp up   Millionaires made over night on this stock  It kept rising and rising till it was worth more than legacy auto makers and all was well   But disaster struck citron did a short report  In it they discovered horrific truths      Trevor Milton's truck didn't exist  It was a prop he pushed down a hill and recorded to make investors believe the truck actually drove       The ""tech"" he claimed to have didn't exist  It was random electrical parts with duck tape over their logos to make you believe its a ""prototype""       The ""factory"" being built didn't exist the field was empty and the ground wasn't even broken       Worse Trevor Milton was exposed as a prolific scam artist who did similar scams before       To make things even worse a family member accused him of molestation       Because of this the SEC opened an investigation into NKLA and Trevor   NKLA stock drilled but WSB rejoiced  It thought it found a unicorn everyone could buy puts and be rich on a stock that should be worthless! An infinite money cheat!  People loaded up on puts EOD and waited for tendies ton show   But they did not show NKLA kept going up  It went up and up for weeks and any drills were temporary  It had been pumped by traders who were also buying Hertz stock   WSB was caught in a YOLO that made sense too much sense for the 2020 covid market  NKLA was seen as a ""discount value stock"" and that Citron were liars and the SEC would find nothing   WSB got worn down over time and forced to exit their positions   And that is how WSB lost to a scam artist who built a Fred Flintstone truck ",2021-03-15 23:17:44.137996

GME would not cause the system to collapse but it would expose how the system is manipulated   [This video explains how]https://www youtube com/watch?v=I0WXg5T3cBE the system could collapse if the SEC were to enforce FTDs   The concept is simple someone sells shares they don't have then they take that money out of the system buys a lambo 5th house   Entities manipulate the system to kick the can down the road and it is feared this could be a large percent of trades between 7-35% according to the video      We have no idea how bad it is   But if the theories are correct and looking at 2008 and all the shit they do I would not be surprised ,2021-03-15 23:18:25.826229

They can do anything they want   The reason the stock hasn't crashed back to the $40-$60 range is because damn near all the float is owned by retail   They've lost their power they just haven't switched to just straight options fuckery yet because they don't realize it yet   Last week's $4m put sink was evidence they are running out of real stock to borrow  They were testing it out   If a stock's float is 100% owned by people holding it regardless of a short squeeze it should rocket until people or institutions start selling ,2021-03-15 23:19:37.873237

"GameStop Stock Fell So Much It Had to be Halted  That Didn't Stop the Selloff  -- [Barrons com]https://Barrons com  Today 4:20 PM ET Dow JonesPrint  By Connor Smith   GameStop stock dropped suddenly Monday morning prompting a brief halt due to volatility  The stock fell wider than 15% to as low as $223 00 bounced back and then fell even lower   &#x200B;  Shares of videogame retailer GameStop ticker: GME this month have surged back near their late January levels this month  At the close GameStop stock was down 17% to $220 13   &#x200B;  The company said last week that Chewy CHWY co-founder Ryan Cohen and former Chewy executive Alan Attal were joined by Kurt Wolf managing member and chief investment officer of activist investor Hestia Capital Management on a new board committee aimed at transforming GameStop into a technology business   &#x200B;  Cohen kicked off GameStop's run by building a roughly 13% stake in 2020 and urged the company to pivot more toward e-commerce offerings  He joined the company's board with two associates in January sending GameStop shares parabolic in the weeks that followed  Analysts pointed to speculative options activity and the closing of some aggressive bearish bets from hedge funds   &#x200B;  Last month GameStop announced the planned departure of Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell  A person familiar with the matter told Barron's at the time that the company thought it was the right time and was looking for a new executive with a technology background   &#x200B;  GameStop's latest run began following a Feb  18 Congressional hearing on trading of its stock and Robinhood  The hearing included an appearance by Keith Gill the YouTube personality known as RoaringKitty who has developed a following for his successful long position in GameStop stock dating back to 2019; Gill revealed in a Feb  19 post that he doubled his GameStop holdings   &#x200B;  While some analysts are upbeat about the company's turnaround prospects the highest price target listed by FactSet is $33  That analyst Telsey Advisory Group's Joseph Feldman pointed to valuation concerns despite his ""high fundamental expectations and projected multiyear benefits from the transformation ""  &#x200B;  The company said it will report fiscal-fourth-quarter results next week  Like other so-called meme stocks favored by retail traders such results present a risk to the company's sky-high run-up    \#**That said trying to call a near-term top for GameStop has been a fool's errand especially for short-sellers facing unlimited downside **",2021-03-15 23:19:38.003065

Correct me if I'm wrong here   Kicking the can means they short   When they short they borrow stock sell it to drive the price down and get money in hand   They don't need much cash on hand to short it   Raising money means they are preparing to either cover their shorts or buy a fuck ton of options to cover their positions   It could also be preparing for the FTDs   Raising money seems like they're getting our tendies ready   🚀🌕🚀🌕,2021-03-15 23:21:23.435034
Original text:   Hey all I've been wary of a certain meme coin for a while  And I've been wondering why a wrinkle brain like Elon is pumping an inflationary joke coin  I digress    I now think people are so enamored with the idea that that certain meme coin is going to make them rich somehow that they're blind to what's really going on  And I'm pretty sure what's really going on is that Musk is pumping Sirius XM a company named after a star in Canis Major the greater dog  Elon's tweets yesterday mention Sirius and refers to the dog days of Summer  The dog days of summer idea comes from Ancient Greek/Roman belief that the return of the Dog Star was responsible for bringing heat and fever  And the dog days were marked by the return of Sirius each year  Then he and DFV tweeted about music  And SpaceX has already launched SiriusXM satellites  https://spacenews com/spacex-launches-siriusxm-satellite/ On Falcon 9  Which Elon tweeted about twice yesterday too  I think everyone is sleeping on something huge because of all the stupidity with that coin that must not be named  And SiriusXM is a low risk play to me  Cheap and potential that Elon pump catalyst happening  Not financial advice but this one gives me serious fomo ,2021-03-15 23:21:41.036156

Again they’ll just keep getting fined cause they’re gonna make the government way more money that way than just buying the shares so why stop the cash flow? This is my understanding and I might be missing something but idk  I don’t have a huge understanding of the system to that level so I couldn’t explain further but of the company recalls shares for multiple reasons then all the shares must be accounted for and there’s where shit WILL hit the fan but that’s as far as my knowledge will go and the rest would be speculation which I don’t wanna misinform  Probably someone here could explain better than I have but from what I understand and know if you keep holding you will make an absurd amount of money on this stock for sure ,2021-03-15 23:24:13.466198

Not to introduce fud but to hear more perspectives:  What if the institutional longs backing us dipped?

The stock price is determined on how long apes hold  The longer apes hold the higher it goes  If every single ape set their selling limits to $500000 then the hedgies have no choice but to buy it at that price  I think it will last more than an hour but it could be a day or two  That’s why setting limits helps that way if you are not paying attention it will automatically sell it at that price  The squeeze will happen when least expected so no one know when  Just got to be prepared ,2021-03-15 23:24:39.989344

Expect another short ladder attack between the hours of 11AM and noon on Wednesday or Thursday   A decrease in 10% like we saw today kicks in the SSR rule so the stock can't be shorted for the remainder of the trade day and the following day   Last Wednesday it hit at 11:55AM  Today it hit around 11:15AM  The issue will be if they can acquire enough stock to short to do it twice between now and Friday or just save it up and go for the hail Mary on Thursday or Friday   I'm guessing 11AM gives enough time for them to see the trend and where to set their puts or they're just waiting for us to be on our crayon lunch break hoping to trigger as many stop loss trades on the way down ,2021-03-15 23:29:36.537106

You make really good points and I actually agree with most of it   On ‘fool proof enclosure’ in the tech world it is understood that as soon as something ‘fool proof’ is made they’ll just invent a better fool  They don’t even mean it sarcastically  Users will do things that go far and FAR beyond the reasonably expected behaviour of what someone in that position is intended to do  And for reasons that defy explaining  Astronauts have a proverb to celebrate that kind of thinking: there’s no situation so bad that you can’t make it worse   What you can’t do is to ‘plan for all eventualities’  A you have no idea what that would mean B you couldn’t possibly afford to C you will have missed whole categories of stuff that you had no idea somebody would try   What you can do is build protocols with regards to the environment the cage the walk ways the animals the people etc and have general strategies to handle those  “When trouble starts immediately separate all the humans from the animals; send the animals to their pens; close off certain areas; break out the emergency equipment which would always have a tranquilliser gun or some such; call an ambulance etc  You give people a plan and then you train on those plans  Plans are always realistic and manageable and they are trained for so that everybody understands what the plan is in any given situation why colleagues do what they do what the likely outcome is what to watch out for  That’s responsible   As far as Harambe is concerned I would not kill him    1  Harambe is an alpha male he is the strongest in the troupe  He knows that  A kid is not going to challenge that  Harambe understands that kids can be brats he will understand that this is a human child he is not going attack it  I just invent a system with operand conditioning: suppose someone falls into the enclosure the animals need to be distracted  How do you distract them? By making them understand they get a special treat: their favourite food I have no idea what that would be someone at the zoo would understand what that looks like  How is that message conveyed? By playing a piece of music that is only ever and exclusively used for that occasion  They know: when that music plays the **BEST TREAT IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE** is waiting for them  Come’n get it! Food is an incredibly strong incentive for an animal  The kid might be interesting but if it’s not attacking if it’s not really doing anything how important can it really be? It’s certainly not important enough to let the other lesser individuals get a stab at the tasty morsels first  That kid is just not important enough in comparison   2  I don’t kill Harambe not even if he harms/kills the child  My stone cold reason: there’s plenty more humans than there are gorillas and the gorillas never asked for any of our bullshit   3  By killing Harambe we place the onus of our extremely poor planning behaviour and upbringing on the animal  The animal was not doing anything other than going through its day in an enclosure that it would not seek for itself  What do we do: when we make a mistake the animal gets to pay for it with its life  It is as quintessentially human as you can get: I didn’t do it it’s not my fault  And if it is I don’t want to pay for it  And if someone else has to be absolutely shitcanned to get there so be it   4  By killing Harambe we are sending the message: you don’t have to worry about anything  If you do something bone-headedly stupid the animal will pay for it  Humans don’t have to learn the lesson  If Harambe had harmed/killed the child and I don’t believe that he would have and the zoo’s response was: people listen you can’t just walk into enclosures with wild animals  These are wild animals they do their own thing we’re not going to kill an animal that was just going through its day  We regret the loss of life killing another life is not going to make it better  It would teach visitors that they had to pay attention it is never a bad thing to apply situational awareness but more importantly: that they will be expected to show restraint and not do anything stupid  I can tell you right now there won’t be too many kids trying that stunt again   There was a movie about a man in a zoo who absolutely had to stick his arm through the fence to taunt the lion  Yes he actually did that somebody was filming that  The lion being an apex predator starts mauling the man’s arm  Because: obviously? Are you going to kill the lion? Is it the lion’s fault the man is too stupid to live like: literally? Is the mere fact that he’s interacting with an adult apex predator not of and by itself enough of a signal? This is an adult man by the way this is not a child  Again the enclosure could be better secured that was definitely an issue but again: not the lion’s problem and an easy warning for the man to behave himself we cannot hold the animals responsible for our stupid mistakes  It is unfair to put that onus on them  We should and do know better we should not do these things of which we know they will turn out bad for us if we insist on trying   Asian families go to Yellowstone Park  To commune with nature  They believe the bison are tame  So they visit them all smiles for a photo opportunity  Bison are extremely protective of their young and their herd  Male bison can weigh 900 kg and move at 60km/h  You’re actually being chased by a freight train coming at you at full tilt   Harambe should not have been killed  It wasn’t his fault  He did not ask for it he was not responsible his range of behaviour is limited to what his instincts and group dynamics taught him  Asking for cogitation and ‘reasonable’ responses from the perspective of humans is stupid on a level we should be ashamed to ever admit to as the supposedly superior being on this planet this is obviously not aimed at you this goes to the wider humanity and I’ll hasten to say that I’m not exactly on my first dumbass mistake in my life just so we’re clear on that ,2021-03-15 23:30:28.824631

"The problem with shorting a stock when you're a hedge fund or perhaps lack of a problem for them is that they don't have to buy back the shorted share  They can hide them in ETFs hide it in a call/put spread hide them in reaaaally far OTM calls if you have a short it's an agreement to buy a stock at a lower price in the future when you buy a OTM call you are making an agreement to buy a stock at a higher price in the future so they cancel because technically you have a right to both and you say ""but look I don't really have a short because I have a right to buy this stock at this date!"" What they're doing now is undercutting the price correct and what will EVENTUALLY happen is they will be forced to cover their shorts  Every short borrowed share has a daily fee   7~ % for today for example so technically we can hold our shares indefinitely until they run out of money to maintain their positions  Or a share callback happens for a board meeting  There could be a stock split  All reasons shorts would have to cover  For now all we do is buy and hold  Its the recipe to success ",2021-03-15 23:30:51.896379

Low volume just means low volume   lack of interest/volatility     After months of watching this insanely awesome stock bounce all over   this is the calm before the storm   If there really were paper-hands selling right now   they are the ones that day trade only     They never had diamond hands just day traders looking for volatility and it didn't show up   They'd be in at 250 out at 300 taking the little greasy tendie at the bottom of our buckets   instead they did nothing and walk away with less today   I'd be curious to know how many of us there are on WSB in the stock   Is there any way to see traders with < $1M in the stock? or <$500k in the stock?   If those are selling/buying on the day   that would show the paperhandedness of the day   We need a paperhanded-ness chart!,2021-03-15 23:31:30.328367

Expect another short ladder attack between the hours of 11AM and noon on Wednesday or Thursday   A decrease in 10% like we saw today kicks in the SSR rule so the stock can't be shorted for the remainder of the trade day and the following day   Last Wednesday it hit at 11:55AM  Today it hit around 11:15AM  The issue will be if they can acquire enough stock to short to do it twice between now and Friday or just save it up and go for the hail Mary on Thursday or Friday   I'm guessing 11AM gives enough time for them to see the trend and where to set their puts or they're just waiting for us to be on our crayon lunch break hoping to trigger as many stop loss trades on the way down ,2021-03-15 23:31:37.998907

Realistic price expectation for a surge before the NSCC liquidates all shorts and like five different hedgefunds all go bankrupt is $2600  However if it doesn't happen this week its likely to drop back down to 100 and trade sideways all the way until July because OI / PRC / Max Pain      Hedge funds are ran by psychopaths  Their immunity to psychological fatigue is their greatest strength  Time is on their side  Don't get attached to dates  If this run does end try to get out above your cost basis  And when it plummets back to Earth buy the fuck back in hard and forget you even own any GME  The hedgies are arrogant and absolutely will put their neck back in the noose ,2021-03-15 23:31:43.219647

Proceeds to completely ignore the post   That would be super cool but the point is putting hard dates and expectations is setting up for failure  People get upset when the magic man from the internets promise doesn't come true and they sell   Regardless of the events the simple fact exists if they are still seriously over shorted if a large enough percentage of the float buys and holds they will eventually have to pay the piper and launch day cometh   We absolutely do not know when or really if that happens  But it is the nature of play   Not financial advice ,2021-03-15 23:33:45.041295

To be honest no ER can justify the kind of run GME has had since it's last ER and stop it from dropping  Maybe if they announce that they bought out AMZN or some big name like that then we can expect it to go up   No matter how much we like the stock we need to set realistic expectations for ourselves and others that might get effected  Only then we can prepare for what's to come and plan how to overcome those challenges and hurdles ,2021-03-15 23:39:35.035188

It’s going to be **REALLY REALLY** bad before it gets insanely good   $60 billion means they have enough money to short the stock 6-10x over  Meaning they can get it down to *literally pennies* even with buying resistance from retail and other larger funds   If people keep holding then they’re truly fucked  $50k/share would not be a meme anymore  However what’s the likelihood people will diamond hand through when the stock drop down to *pennies*?  Personally I’m already playing with only house money so I can hold to $0 and not flinch  So I’m holding forever  I’ve set my WeStock notice to $500/share just so I can get notified when it happens and manually check like once or twice a week ,2021-03-15 23:39:39.957932

You don't just stop shorting and switch   You have to cover your short ie buy shares   GME only has 50 million tradeable shares  not a lot and estimates on short very from a lot to a holy fuckton amount   Remember the goal was to make Gamestop a Blockbuster and they didn't   With bankruptcy no short has to cover   they just reap absurd profits   Gamestop isn't bankrupt and is now in a very healthy transition and it is very likely that there are not enough shares to cover ,2021-03-15 23:39:54.713886

Thanks for challenging me!    I’m using iborrowdesk com as a sentiment gauge  High available shares = low chance of shorting versus low available shares = high chance of shorting especially when the trends on iborrowdesk com justify the change in stock price     As for Ape sell off I don’t think this had a major impact considering the volume was 350K at the peak of sell off and we saw almost identical changes in shares available to borrow     I think some good question for retail bears is    how do you explain the low volume with change in share price? low volume usually means rising price as the market maker adjusts the ask price to incentivize trading — they make money off volume    How do you explain the sharp increase from $50 to $200 on 2/24? Someone was forced to buy and it wasn’t retail  Those retards didn’t jump in until 2/26 - 2/27 the only other time we’ve had significant volume at 20M    There are a lot of big indicators that someone is really fucked and it’s kind of hard to ignore ,2021-03-15 23:40:17.955443

Hedge funds going bankrupt doesnt prevent the fact that positions must be covered and shares must be bought/sold  A contract is a contract  What will happen is the market makers who wrote the contracts will be on the line for them and if they cant afford to cover - the banks will  If the situation gets SO out of hand that the banks can't help? Insurance  The US banks have a 60 trillion dollar insurance plan for this reason   For now my plan is 💎👐 I can't tell you what to do with your stocks  This is a free for all  Realistically and I'll probably be downvoted for this I'll be selling my first share out of 5 at 1000 and every 500 interval after that Ill sell a share   The best course of action is to always hold a stock until the fall after a peak because you could sell on the way up at only 10% of where the stock will actually go  It's hard to tell how far a stock will climb when fundamentals are ignored its easy to tell when its returning to normality   The main thing to remember is we all did this to make money  You have to ask yourself how much money would you be comfortable with making where the feeling of missing out on potential further gains doesn't really outweigh what you made  For me all I want is to give the 🖕 to the same hedge funds that put my family through a very tough time since 2008 and make enough money to allow myself to not have to work during my final year of college ,2021-03-15 23:41:16.667200

Margin doesn't do that  If you have a stock that's 100% of your portfolio it can raise above 100% in the calculation for some reason  My guess is because portfolio value is updated asynchronously from the stock value so it does something like account value/shares owned*share price to calculate the percentage where account value can be a little old  If the stock goes down it typically shows over 100% for a second or so and that's my best guess as to why ,2021-03-15 23:41:19.579201

If you buy a call you don't *have to* buy any of the shares but you can  If you exercise the contract then you buy all 100 for the agreed upon price strike price  So all contracts either will or will not be exercised for all 100 shares  If they're not exercised it's because there was no point e g  you have a contract saying you can buy shares from me for $20 a piece but you could get them for $17 a piece on the market and so the contract just expires worthless and disappears ,2021-03-15 23:44:35.937593

NOK is trading about $4 30 at the close today   Let's say you pay  07 for your $5c 3/19   One contract is 100 shares so you pay $7 plus commission for per contract   The strike price of $5 is out-of-the-money which means it is ALL premium   There is no intrinsic value   If you bought the $4 call it is  30 in the money  The intrinsic value is the current market value minus the strike price   Premium evaporates for the duration of the option and at expiration you have only intrinsic value for an in-the-money option or zero value for an out-of-the-money option because the premium is all gone   To break even on the $5c 3/19 option the stock would have to climb  70 to reach the strike price plus  07 to pay for the option premium you paid plus a little extra for the commissions   NOK stock would have to climb a little more than  77 in four days   That's about an 18% increase in four days just to break even   Any closing price over $5 07 would get you a profit minus commissions   At the same closing price on expiration the $4c will be 5 07 in the money and that's what you could sell the option for   If you don't sell it the broker may automatically exercise it and you will buy 100 shares of NOK for $400 per options contract   If you don't want to do that be sure to sell the option before closing ,2021-03-15 23:44:54.057695

I usually would be happy to see another ape holding but if these profits can help you wipe away accounts in collection maybe you should consider selling maybe one or two shares to give you some room  We always say only put in what you can afford to lose and if you’re in collections well that’s the definition of money you can’t afford to lose  Gme can moon and I hope it does but it can also tank and tank hard like 3 weeks ago and that wouldn’t be good for your marriage    Good luck bro whatever you decide ,2021-03-15 23:46:21.517377

GameStop isn’t a publisher  GameStop isn’t an eSports provider  GameStop isn’t a console manufacturer  GameStop’s legacy business of “used gaming” is nosediving   GameStop until recently has be incinerating cash to mall leases for stores that barely turn a profit   Yes I think GameStop will be a major video gaming hub and Ryan Cohen is a genius @ $14B it is completely speculative and contingent that this guy turns around a sinking ship    $5B yeah I’d be okay with that but GME is worth $14B based on a successful Pet-Food retailer founder-team that hasn’t produced a plan yet? No fucking way   If Ryan Cohen himself doesn’t come into that  earnings call clearly defining the path to success and transformation with quantitative forecasts and growth targets this stock is going to absolutely plummet    I’m bullish on GME but at this current price you need to understand it is NOT even CLOSE to any fundamental value  That’s okay the price is a reflection of failed market mechanics but don’t fool yourself that this thing is going to maintain this price for very long  Either retail gives up or hedge funds give up  The price will either swing up then down or just down ,2021-03-15 23:46:54.871427

If you believe RC can transform GME into a powerhouse than any price up to $1-2k per share is a deal; that is if you intend to stay in for the long haul 3-5 years  How anyone can look at what he & his team were able to do with Chewy and not price in innovation & fmv is beyond me  That's why this earnings call is so crucial  Everyone has laser focused eyes on GME right now and it would be silly to assume that RC & GME haven't jumped on this opportunity and are in talks with everyone under the sun for deals/partnerships/pivots/debt consolidation/etc  They're probably doing every possible thing in order to set GME up for rapid growth and transformation   The end of this week and next week is going to be wild ,2021-03-15 23:47:02.293392

A  It ain't happening  B  I like GME  Right at 40ish  I even make money off the volatility  If others want to lose their shirts fine by me  I need to buy back my calls for a profit at some point    or get them called away for a profit at some point  No difference to me  I'll still be long on GME as I will buy more when below 50  I like the stock   C  I don't mind the Rollercoaster but all the good DD for other stock are overrun by newbs masturbating to stupid posts like 10000 per share!

Question regarding catalyst 2 and the shitadel bond issue     Who in their right mind would want to invest a cpl of billion with them considering the hole they have dug for themselves?

That I'm not sure about  There's a lot of uncertainties what would make me feel better is to see volume and evidence UIs are on our side otherwise there's a good chance we will get dicked around by hedges and possibly even pumped and dumped on imo which is my fear,2021-03-15 23:50:40.522771
as someone who frequents the GME sub i have like 5 shares i have insight to inter workings of GMEanon  basically these 2 mods HeyItsPixel and Rensole write a bunch of DD’s that get the retards hyped and then when it doesn’t happen they blame ladder attacks  here’s a video from the mods https://youtu be/q759Y26qFIE,2021-03-15 23:50:41.119250

Options on TQQQ were more expensive and volatile  I would wait until the market crashes and then buy 5K TQQQ options 2 years out,2021-03-15 23:50:43.993142
Echoing what others have said  I smell blood and fear  If they covered their original shorts and there was nothing to see this insane gamestop trading action would cease to exist    Whether it's tomorrow next week next month or next year these fake shares will fail to deliver and a bill will come due as long as people hold stock    They are cornered into a forced purchase situation and they will fight to the death  But a lot of us can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent  At least I know I can  The 10k I invested doesn't change my life one way or another I'm lucky in this regard  Invest what you are willing to lose or live without and you'll be at peace with holding waiting and anticipating the day the bill comes due   Not financial advice  I eat crayons  I just like the stock    113 shares @ $120 average ,2021-03-15 23:50:45.093378

Well if GME transforms as I expect it to I don't think the current price point represents me bag holding   You're right though delays in price movement would be exactly the game I'd try to play if I were a HF trying to shake out retail not sure on the gov intervention but it's definitely a potential mind game,2021-03-15 23:51:35.024431

You are absolutely right  People pedalling this 10k+ BS are either ignorant or trying to sell the idea so others hold on longer than they themselves will  Rule #1 of a massively inflated price is you want to be first off at the top    We are already seeing volume issues in the 200-300 range as people look at cheaper volatile stocks likely why AMC is suddenly seeing a resurgence ,2021-03-15 23:51:36.563717

No I’m sorry that’s just nonsense   First where we are today is a direct result of a Congress and the government that knows no limits on its power  Almost nothing the government in Washington spends money on is constitutional and therefore legal   Second the “inadequate tax policy“ against which you rail had the amusing effect of increasing total revenue to Washington so the idea that more or higher tax rates are needed in order to make up a shortfall is ridiculous   The problem is the spending  It’s ALWAYS the spending  The government has no money it has only what it takes from productive people by force  Taxes are not investments they always result in a loss of productivity and a loss of buying power  Taxation and government spending are the least efficient ways of achieving anything and for that reason should be kept at the barest minimum something nobody in Washington and far too few citizens understand ,2021-03-15 23:55:12.418375

And how exactly do you know that we are the ones buying those 800 calls? might aswell be the hedgies i hardly see redditors buying far otm calls  the 19/3 800calls alone make up for 25% of the float let's say hedgies own 20% so IF GME were to hit 800+ by friday they have  1: hedged some of their losses on initial shorts  2: own 20% of the float that they can short and dump again   it seems far more likely that it's them buying those calls the volume and open interest on the 800s is so huge and we've said over and over again that you shouldn't expect the squeeze on any set date ,2021-03-15 23:56:52.336585

Check the 30 minute chart  It had a double-top at 280 which is a bearish signal  Then it crossed below the 180-day MA which is another depreciating factor  This is based on TECHNICAL analysis which proves we are in a downtrend  Take your profits if you have them or hold for a few weeks while they keep this stock suppressed and have to let it run up to cover the shorts ,2021-03-15 23:57:22.180465

QE and lowering the fed rate decreased bond yields and increased their prices last year  This year inflation will begin to accelerate making growth stocks even more attractive forcing the bond market to increase yields and decrease prices in response  When bond prices and yields hit an attractive price point money flows into the bonds market to lock in a guaranteed 10 year return that will beat expected inflation  That’s what happened this past month  This periodic flow into the bond market will continue to occur periodically as bond prices and yields fluctuate which slows the decline of bond prices  But if inflation accelerates which it inevitably will given the current economic scenario bond prices will continue downward as high growth stocks will only become more sought after   So what does this mean? Will the fed rate is down keep buying growth stocks   Want to get fancy and make guaranteed money in the bond market? Short long term treasury bonds Buy TMV,2021-03-15 23:57:52.297582

The best case scenario right now would be for the WSB crowd to take profits selling their shares back to shorts at these inflated prices  Let it come back down to 70-80 range and then buy back twice as many shares and wait for the next HF whale to make a play and let it rip like last time  Keep doing the same thing over and over buying dips and selling rips and everyone can double up their share count each time with enough profit left over to save every species of ape ,2021-03-15 23:59:12.528338
"That would be fine but the problem is that they cant even get a legitimate share to trade   All the stuff out there is FTD or the ""Float""   They couldn't just trade the same share 200000000 times without affecting the price  It would also take too long   The moment they get their hands on one real share it gets swapped with a FTD to satisfy an FTD that is waiting for their authentic share   Since they are the only ones who created the FTD they are the only ones who can satisfy the ""lack-of"" share    Think of it like this    someone is MISSING their share That the HF caused to go missing by shorting  Once the shorter buys a share it does not become their share it's used to satisfy their debt of a share   So it's not like they actually have a share to re-sell again unless they short another share    again    putting them right back at the missing share    again ",2021-03-15 23:59:12.529001

If I can get my hands on a table of Level 2 data I think taking a sum of all the buy limit orders and averaging the price will give a much better idea of what the shares are actually worth to the majority of people  Well at least those with limit orders set  Simple math will show that the the average of these is going to be higher than the last trade price   This won't be perfect because a lot of apes don't even have limit sell orders set  But it's better than seeing the price that the HFs are trying to make us thing other apes value the stock at   I have level 2 data with my broker but I can't export it to Excel  If any other ape has this data and willing to share feel free to send it my way and I will run some numbers ,2021-03-15 23:59:53.230707

This is laughable   Did you know 1 share last year is only worth 1/4 of a share now? Yes they diluted their shares that much in the past year taking advantage of retail   Even if they are successful it won't warrant more than $1 per share unless something radically changes long term from the trend pre covid   They were $4 dollars pre covid and there is not new game plan they are doing now that warrants their price being higher than pre covid   Once all the hype is over whether 3 months from now or 3 years from now you will be left with a $1 dollar stock at most ,2021-03-15 23:59:59.123083

Listen here dick-breath; I’m fully aware of the “transformation” of GME  I’ve been long shares since August of 2020 and have followed this saga very closely since   GameStop isn’t a video game publisher   GameStop isn’t an eSports company   GameStop isn’t a console manufacturer   GameStop’s biggest revenue stream used games is taking a Drill Team Six nosedive   Ryan Cohen a genius and innovator with his crew of Chewy execs have a massive task of essentially building A BRAND NEW BUSINESS    Can they do it? Absolutely  But at $14B market cap with NO strategic roadmap defined and with all the headwinds they face from their existing brick-and-mortars you need to wake the fuck up and realize that GME is incredibly overvalued  Half of WSB is buying GME because stonks go up  or to prove a point to the “man”  Even if GME gets MOASS squeezed that cash will trade hands barely any of it will make its way into the actual business and anyone left bagholding will have to wait 456+ years to realize a $14B market cap   I’m long GME as a business but at this price point it’s retarded to buy for any reason other than scalping the technicals / momentum,2021-03-16 00:01:16.637969

There is no reasonable call option you can afford  And that is why your correctly state GME is over again   It may come back though but this round is over   When the calls get this expensive look at $200 or $300 calls on most of those stocks are expensive  Ones that move get real expensive ones that move like crazy like gme    Options are out of control price wise     So typical retail investors are unable to participate in the options side of the house   This then kills the gamma squeezes as MM stop having to buy more share to cover huge options positions  Infact it has the opposite impact  The Mm sell their coverage shares and poof it's like a short is pumping the market with shares but it's not it's just MM who don't need the protection anymore   Gme will burn back to 40/50 from here  Maybe make a new floor even higher and you guys will probably push the cycle again  Who knows how long it can continue ,2021-03-16 00:01:26.916313

Lol cool that’s your opinion  I’ll be back to gloat once it’s over  People like you thought $200 was impossible when it dropped to $50   DD is still ready to find for other stocks if you bothered to look  So far the only money I’ve lost is on options for boomer stocks based on DD I found on WSB the very thing you’re complaining you can’t find  You know which options made me money? GME and AMC   So really I think r/stocks or r/investing will be better for you if you need DD on the front page for some non-relevant stocks  There’s a reason everyone is talking about GME and AMC atm,2021-03-16 00:03:30.820868

Some astrology DD: the 19th will have significance for GME but so will late March/early April  In the upcoming day transit Mercury will cross over its natal Mercury from its IPO listing date  Mercury has various significations but most importantly it rules over stocks online exchanges and digital currency  I expect extreme volatility which will settle down until early April when Jupiter rules over abundance and money approaches Uranus sudden changes  More news may come out about GME and it's company's plans that will have more people flocking to the stock than ever before ,2021-03-16 00:03:34.954873

Not exactly  My understanding is that FTD occur when there is naked short selling i e  the hedgies are selling stocks to the market that don't actually exist  So normally when you short sell you're going to borrow a share from A to sell to B and then you give A an IOU for the stock you borrowed  But with naked shorting the hedgies basically write their *own* IOU without every borrowing anything and then they sell the IOU to B directly  They may even borrow it right back from B to cover their tracks so long as B is trading with a margin account  But the issue is that it's blatantly illegal for a hedge fund or anyone else for that matter besides market makers in specific circumstances to write IOUs in this way and sell shares that they haven't borrowed from elsewhere       As far as GME longs are concerned the FTDs are icing on the cake  The issue with the short position is that they wrote more IOUs than there are still shares available to trade because institutions and insiders are holding more than 100% of the float  The fact that some of those IOUs may have been written by themselves just makes their behavior blatantly illegal on top of being insanely risky       P S  not a financial advisor not an expert I just like the stock  Long GME,2021-03-16 00:04:32.993989

"To give credit where credit is due:  The attack plan looks like it was to line up stimulus drops to the pump of AMC to distract from GME since its a higher buy in and cheaper stock would be more accessible at 1400   If this was the case this was a smart attempt to amplify the after-effect of the attack on GME we saw today confidence wise  Amplify a shake on paper hand FUD convert  whole GME'ers to AMC'ers break confidence and divide apes against one another all by using this new money as the glint in the eye ctalyst  Well played since we're nearing end of quarter realignment AND the company press release which will both likely have more positive results than negative for GME poising it for a huge run soon IMO   Ultimately it was a very shitty band-aid for the shorts though  Eloquent plan but seems futile if us HODL'ers don't succumb to the current ""War of Attrition""   Remember that attrition isn't just financial  It's psychological  Somewhat Physical too if you're not used these hours or this kind of market fatigue and constant information absorbing  Or just have addictive habits   Always try to see the bigger picture and even more so avoid confirmation bias  The clearest picture is the right one not the one that looks best to you    And as always too always do whats best for you  Whatever that may be   Good Luck Friends",2021-03-16 00:04:47.738688

Vanguard's financial buissness model is simple elegant and unlike Robinhood's order flow bullshit not inherently positioned against the user  There is no inherent systematic paths to ethical temptations that could lead to illegal unethical or destructive shortcuts beyond the risks of access to tons of money in the first place  Most hedgefunds I would argue don't add anything useful to the country either on that same basis of judgement  What positive value was Kenny G providing the country when he bet to destroy Gamestop a company employing thousands with honest work?  And that more than anything else is how you can trust Vanguard over Technofrat Robinhood or any hedgefund any day   Honestly I would extend that filter to picking any buissness to patronage  Is the companies's buissness model set with or against it's user?  If it's set against its users it will fall to illigal behavior on purpose eventually no matter any official ethical standard ,2021-03-16 00:07:11.074131

> Is there ever a time where you try and buy a share and it tells you that you can’t because there’s not enough to go around?  yes/no   There is always a price in place for buying/selling a share  The change in price happens with supply and demand   If the people holding feel like their share is worth more they will have a higher price set   For those who feel like it's worth less their price will be less    Right now it's really weird  There is artificial supply and a reasonable demand   Hence why the price is where it is at   With this kind of demand lacking any artificial shares there is a potential just for argument's sake 5 times more demand than there is shares    Since the market has potentially 5 times MORE shares than there should be the supply is pretty darn high in comparison to the reasonably high demand ,2021-03-16 00:07:20.510605
Yeah that is a theoretical situation that can happen  Institutions hold stock too though a whole fucking lot of the stock  Big brokers like Fidelity and Vanguard hold MASSIVE amounts of the stock  It's up to them to decide how much is available to short from their holdings  They can loan their holdings to whomever they please  The more retail interest there is on the rest of the float however the less appealing it is to loan those shares out  Why would you loan something out for an interest payment when the underlying would make you more money anyway?  Also let say I'm on Vanguard  If I want to buy GME and there aren't enough shares to go around on the open market  They are going to sell me some of their shares  They are my broker so technically they can work it so they are both of our shares while I hold them and take the risk but they are on the hook then if it goes up  They already own the shares though too so it isn't a huge downside for them like it would be for a HF short  They just take your money when you bought the buyer pays the new higher price when you sell and they will happily facilitate that  That is one way a broker is different than a hedge fund   Hedge funds on the other hand need to borrow these shares from someone and they did it WAY before $40 a share was a thing  If they borrowed at $20 and it's at $200 now that's a 10 fold loss plus interest  They can try to sell at stupid low prices to each other all they want but the demand for shares exceeds $200 a share in value with retail and there is no float  So the price goes up instead of down  they may induce a dip but it gets bought back immediately ala last Wednesday   In other words as retail continues to buy and hold the more solidified the price gets  trades between HF's don't matter because they don't reflect the real market  Look at GME like gaming video cards right now  Yeah you might have an in to get them at MSRP through insider means but the general retail market remains inflated due to demand ,2021-03-16 00:07:22.052590

"230c means $230 is the strike point which means that once the stock value is over $230 u/VicTheRealest has the option but not the obligation to exercise his contract    If he exercises then he can buy 100 shares of $GME for $230/share no matter what the actual market value is    BUT just because the market value goes over 230 doesn't mean he is going to profit? Why? Because he had to pay a premium to purchase that call option  The premium is what you pay to buy the contract and it is nonrefundable--so worst case scenario the market value never hits the strike point 230 and the contract expires at market close on Friday 3/19    Now how does the premium work? It's likely that u/VicTheRealest paid a premium of $45 based on his estimate of GME hitting 275  So that means $45 per share which is 45x100 each option contract is for 100 shares  So his all-in cost for the contract is $4500 and that is his maximum loss    So at a premium of $45 and a strike of $230 that means that the market value has to hit $275 and go over 275 before he is making money  At this point he is ITM or ""in the money "" Say the stock shoots up to $300/share and u/VicTheRealest exercises his contract at that moment then sells those shares immediately this is a hypothetical  So that means that he is getting 300x100 shares MINUS the option price of 230x100 shares MINUS his premium of $4500  Total profit: $2500    The other choice he has instead of exercising the contract is selling the contract  By selling the contract he doesn't have to buy those 100 shares at a price of $23000 maybe he doesn't have the funds so he sells the contract to someone who can afford it  Gets back his premium and then some ",2021-03-16 00:08:48.069563

First off $4x100=$400  This is the premium  The premium is paid immediately and it is a sunk cost whether you exercise the contract or not  If you exercise the contract then you must purchase 100 shares at the strike price  This is why you look at the break-even price which is the strike price plus the premium In your scenario the stock would need to go above $114 to be worthwhile exercising the option ,2021-03-16 00:08:55.441638

The whole play here is that there is a limited timeframe that these shorts have to buy back shares and return them to the institutions they borrowed from   The most pivotal GME shareholder meeting in decades is in June 3 months away   RC is making moves and there is every reason to have as many shares aka as many votes as possible before this meeting  Share callback date for those institutions that loaned shares out to shorts and must call them back to be counted as legitimate stock holders is something like April 19th  Don't quote me on that I recall seeing april somewhere and also retards laughing about 4/20 so it's probably the 19th :shrug:  All the DD's have said it will take weeks for shorts to cover due to the volume  April 19th is about a month away   Imo we should see MOASS start either end of this week or end of next ,2021-03-16 00:09:23.634828

It helps in identifying trends and reversals if you know what you’re looking for  Sure it fails but it can provide cues for where to buy and sell  A couple of really good analysts I follow on Twitter use basic tools and demand zones and they called bottoms and tops with near perfect accuracy in this correction  I’m still learning but I use MACD and slow stochastic along with a couple of other demand based indicators I’m starting with on a more advanced software ,2021-03-16 00:12:31.683411

Just how a satellite in high orbit around Earth doesn't fall to the Earth a satellite in orbit of the Sun won't fall to the sun  You have to remember that any satellite leaving the Earths gravitational influence will still orbit the Sun in around the same manner as the Earth in some way just like how if you jump out of a moving car you don't just fall straight down - you fly forward in the direction the car is moving  So reaching the sun requires delta-v for the retrograde burn ,2021-03-16 00:16:05.129257

I accept that there are other things that factor into a stock's price  The baseline of most stocks hovers around where its fundamentals lie but many things can distort that for periods of time   So if we accept that then we can see that there is strong evidence of a fundamental price around $40/50 if we accept DFV's DD but everything above that is speculation   So I'm curious as to why you are certain that this is a temporary dip and not a decline towards $40?,2021-03-16 00:16:34.388138

check out an options profit calculator such as [https://www optionsprofitcalculator com/calculator/long-call html]https://www optionsprofitcalculator com/calculator/long-call html  But yes standard options contracts cover 100 shares so one contract for a $250 strike from the OP's table would cost you $3045    According to that profit calculator in the link GME would have to hit \~$227 or so tomorrow for you to break even  But that breakeven number goes up as expiry approaches   Not financial advice I burn my tongue on lightbulbs regularly ,2021-03-16 00:16:38.844464

Calls and puts are contracts that gives you the *right* but not *obligation* to buy call or sell put at a certain price  Each contract covers 100 shares   4 important numbers here: strike price premium what you buy the contract at current market price and # of shares   For a call it's: Market Price - Strike Price + Premium  x # of shares  For a put it's:  Strike Price + Premium - Market Price x # of shares   Here's a couple examples of how they work   Let's say you buy 1 call at $7 per share or $700 premium since each contract covers 100 shares  The strike price is $10 and the current market value is $50    We get the equation     $50 - 10+7 x 100 which equals $3300 in value   *For Calls you want your Strike Price + Premium to be LOWER than market price for a profit*   Now for a put it's the exact opposite  Using those same numbers we get      10 + 7 - 50 x 100 which equals -3300  This put would basically be worthless  But let's say there's a huge crash and it crashes to $5     Well that's $1200 profit since the put says you can sell at $17 when market price is $5   *For Puts you want your Strike Price + Premium to be HIGHER than market price for a profit*  Disclaimer: I am by no means an expert at calls and puts and it's merely my understanding of them  The formulas may be wrong and other apes feel free to correct me as I am NOT a financial advisor   Note; you must apply through your broker to deal in calls and puts ,2021-03-16 00:18:16.141814

Why did you buy GME in the first place? If it's because of the impending short squeeze of a lifetime why would you sell now? Nothing about the squeeze situation has gotten worse for gme holders  Hedgies will do all they can to drop the price  It may even dip back down to 100 I don't know  But the reality is that eventually and nobody knows when they HAVE to buy back those shares that they shorted  And that will create tremendous buying pressure potentially shooting the price up into tens of thousands per share  Until then the price of the stock doesn't matter    Is it worth it to you to take $500 of gains and potentially miss out on $1M of gains? Sure you might lose that money entirely but imo the potential reward is much higher than the risk    Not financial advice am retard holding 27 @ $210 since January,2021-03-16 00:18:20.122449

The 30 45 is the price per contract  One call is 100 contracts   A call is the option to buy a stock at a given price at a specific point in the future    For example if you buy a 4/19 $380c for say $25 32 you would pay $2532 00 for the right to spend $380 x 100 on 4/19 for 100 shares  So technically the share price needs to reach 380+25 32=400 32 to break even  But if you never wanted to exercise the contracts anyway just sell the options to someone who does want to exercise them ,2021-03-16 00:20:50.991894

Sure you need to pay a fee to borrow the stock but then you collect a massive premium for selling the stock   All of their profit from shorting comes from the sale itself meaning they have been raking in revenue from shorting at $200+ so I kinda doubt this is where they needed their loan,2021-03-16 00:20:58.982821

"What do you think a stock is?  A piece of paper that arbitrarily fluctuates in value?  A stock's intrinsic ""value"" is proportional to the companys future cash flows   People buy shares to stake out a percent ownership in a business for the sake of sharing in that company's profits   A business that isn't profitable will not be able to provide dividend yield nor growth in the future given a healthy unmanipulated market   You can get an army of crayon eating dolts to bubble the price of anything   But at the end of the day reality always sets in baggie ",2021-03-16 00:21:00.741833

I can't believe how long we went between 1/29 and now without discussing the re-upping of call volume  It was front and center and fucking obvious that calls were doing heavy lifting in January and then it changed to hodl only    Yes obviously the premiums are through the roof now but it's still a higher leverage play than shares ,2021-03-16 00:21:54.509281

That's a possibility  I would be willing to bet at this point they need to rebuild the ramp  Basically a round 3  I don't think an MOAS situation is beneficial for them  Because MOAS isn't good for them they probably just want to cycle this situation once or twice more  I truly believe this will fizzle out instead of a giant squeeze eventually the original DD does not describe the situation we are in now nor a situation that is beneficial for long whales who will drive this doubt they want to drive it off a cliff  For that reason I don't think we will find out what's beyond 480 or maybe even 350  Still good money to be made ,2021-03-16 00:22:19.084100

Like the title implies im new to this and im risking all my previous Karma  I'm trying to learn more so it's worth it in my eyes  What is keeping WSB from becoming a HF in it's own right? Lack of funding? Is there a certain amount of donations or contributions it'd have to meet to be considered? Also would it require a figure head so to speak to control the investment strategies? Or is it because we are just dumb apes  Obviously I am    I've never been more intetested in day trading and the potential gains  I come from a poor family literally habe put blood sweat and tears in the work I do now to make it as well as I have thus far but the aspect of potentially giving my body a break and working out my mind as more than a hobby has hit me square in the jaw  Thanks to r/wallstreetbets I have gained double my initial investment maybe pure luck  Actually 99% pure luck  I know losses will come but I'm ready to dive into it all although not without a dive plan    I have had a couple drinks to be quite honest otherwise I probably wouldn't have had the courage to bring up this discussion  My mind is my only insecurity honestly ,2021-03-16 00:22:31.557791

Just 'cause a few people are making the mistake:     Bond Issue is always listed as the full value it's not the number of Bonds  It's not like a Stock where its price\*issued     Each bond is worth $1000 each at maturity however despite being denominated in $1000 bond prices are always listed out of 100       So it is $600 million not $60Billion       Also companies borrow money all the time especially when money is cheap and it is right now them issuing bonds is not indicative of some financial crisis ,2021-03-16 00:23:07.786764

You're missing the important details though   The number of shorts that need to be bought back and the ever increasing price it needs to happen at   Let's say BRK A is being shorted by just 1000 shares   Share price is currently close to $400k   If the vast majority of share holders refuse to sell for anything less than $1 million the protected cost to buy back those 1000 shares is not $400k x 1000 $400m   It's significantly closer to $1m x 1000 $1b   So when it comes time to start closing those shorts much more liquidity is required to start buying with the intention of hopefully buying enough at lower prices to not have anywhere near the protected losses   To put it in the most simplest terms if you knew you had to pay a massive bill soon on the repairs of your new crashed lambo but you don't know exactly how much and you know that when the bill comes that you HAVE to have cash for it or else there will be a hit put out on your wife's bf you're going to make sure you have cash on hand   Sure you won't sell your GME but you'll sell your yacht and private jet that you also got from GME tendies to ensure you can foot the bill when it comes due   We still don't know if the HFs fully covered their shorts probably not because why are there STILL ftd's?   But we do know they needed to liquidate positions to have cash on hand to buy as they go   You can't buy GME with shares of SPY   You can only buy it with cash   And you can only buy a fuck ton of GME with way more cash than what the market value would suggest   There's only like 50k shares that can be bought at once before the price spikes up by $100,2021-03-16 00:23:49.287500

I get that   but from my perspective   I’ve been DCA’ing into fake internet sudokus since before and through a massive crash and recovery   For years every time I put $100 in cb I always tell myself this money is gone   Might as well light it on fire   Do I need this money for x y or z?  If so keep it in my checking and don’t buy   Because of that I’ve never capitulated   Even last March when I checked my Blockfolio app for the first time in a while and saw I was down 80%   Never sold never will until it hits my price target to sell   Sure if you’re holding over 100 shares with a cost basis of <$200   a heavy retrace to <150 or $40 would suck   But I don’t use that money   my net worth calculator would be a bit depressing for a while   but the bills and mortgage would be paid on time my wife and I would still eat out or doordash when we wanted and we would still be financially stable   What’s I’m saying is   fuck the hedge funds   and you can crash that bitch to $4 a share   I’m not fucking leaving   The money is already gone   Don’t miss it   Told myself every time I bought a share I was basically burning it because I’m not selling or minimizing my position at all until $3500   and at that point I’m selling 15% to double my money and letting the rest ride to 10k plus   and I know the odds aren’t super high of that happening ,2021-03-16 00:23:50.596175

"One man's opinion:   Pre covid they were crashing because they had fallen out of favor and had run up crazy amounts of debt  People thought they were going bankrupt  They used the ""share dilution"" to raise hundreds of millions of dollars no interest since it isn't a loan to ensure they don't go bankrupt  Now with that out the window they can get to work finding new ways of getting money   WW84 was a complete mess  That movie alone will ensure all major studios release their blockbusters through the normal channels   People realized during covid how much they love going out and seeing movies  On demand and streaming is convient but not the same  This next year will be crazy with back to back to back monster releases   I don't own shares of AMC anymore  Closed all my positions today  I think it is a bit high and I wanted to lock in gains  I think $10 to $15 is a fair price eventually ",2021-03-16 00:25:36.413085

GME has 20% short of float according to Yahoo   So the chances of another big squeeze are diminishing   Eventually it will start trading on fundamentals   They have earnings coming up and floating between a $15-20B market cap   So if that went to $400/share it would be bigger than Best Buy and up there with some of the biggest retailers in the US with $6B in sales compared to $47B for something like BBY     Im not short but just pointing out facts  Be careful take profits and understand what you’re getting into if you’re tossing around big cash ,2021-03-16 00:25:41.632712

"In this monkey's opinion; They are requesting more liquidity for a reason  The timing is too suspicious as those funds were available on the 10th to use same day there was that massive ""sell off""  But they do offer out bonds on what looks like a two year basis if you go through their history of their other bonds    The BBB rating kinda makes sense as those bonds are not tied to any physical collateral and more susceptible to defaulting seeing as the money is used in a speculative highly liquid market  Imo they are worst than BigBananaBanazas but no one would buy them if they were lower ",2021-03-16 00:26:01.366530

I believe sticking on wsb will give you the impression retail holds more shares than it does and that those shares matter  Tbh we got in the way of the long whales in the first 480 event and if not for us they would have built their ramp better and squeezed it higher  The short side proved they now can stamp any push beyond large option payouts 350 so at least one long whale appears to have quit the game for now  This completely wrecks where my position was btw I expect I just lost money and will not get a payout  I have stocks calls and a put for after the squeeze  All will cost me now  I'm not falling for fud someone showed me it was the options data and the lack of green candles that tells me my bet was incorrect ,2021-03-16 00:27:19.387682

I know you probably want this to be something but        Note that they know the rating before issuing it so if it was below investment grade they'd likely have just not issued any       Also a lot of companies just raise money 'cause its cheap right now       So I know people want this to be something like Citadel is almost bankrupt so GME moon etc    but I think that's wishful thinking ,2021-03-16 00:28:16.647412

"That's not how it works  Low volume doesn't necessarily mean decreasing prices   You may have heard of the ""bid-ask spread""  What this describes is the gap between the lowest price stock being sold the ""ask"" and the highest price someone is willing to pay for the stock the ""bid""  In order for stock to be sold the bid and ask are expected to match   However the bid and the ask can move independently of each other  If sellers aren't satisfied with the prices they're getting they can increase the ask  If sellers want to buy the stock at this price they would have to increase their bid which would drive the stock price up  Driving the stock price up in this way does not depend on high volume ",2021-03-16 00:28:40.508977

Info on shares held by public institutions is here:  https://fintel io/so/us/gme  You could theoretically add up all those numbers then subtract that number from the total number of shares available and that would give you the float  I could do it but math makes my head hurt    Now if you look at the float number consider how much of the “float” is owned by retail longs and daytraders and paperhands  This number except longs will always fluctuate    Now consider the number of shares shorted versus the number of shares in existence  Compare that to the float number  The shorted shares exceeds the float  The shorts are only able to cover the shares that are moving around via daytraders and paperhands  Which is a tiny number compared to the number of shares shorted    Someone has already done this DD  Right?,2021-03-16 00:29:56.386891

AMC 3/19 $6p  AMC 4/16 $6p & $10p  Why?  It's trading way above its precovid market cap at this point   Inb4 I'm full of shit just google AMC dilution and read the excellent articles that will do a better job than I will but if you don't understand what dilution is then know this AMC diluted itself by over 75% since covid started   This is as if a 4x split happened but no one got the extra shares and charts do not adjust for it   If you consider the precovid price to be say $8 in Nov 2019 adjusted for dilution that is $2 today   To put it another way when you adjust today's price to account for the dilution $14 is $56 $14 * 4 in 2019   Are you comfortable buying AMC at $56?  Not me I'm out and I'm bearish as fuck now ,2021-03-16 00:32:55.360483

I really hope we have a huge EPS beat for the quarter   Im not so much worried about rev this second but a huge EPS beat would show that they are moving on the right path     Question: When a company does a quarterly ER and they tell you the EPS is that EPS based off of their initial offering of shares or does that count in all of the shares the market is holding including synthetics created by short sales?,2021-03-16 00:36:35.983814

I mean if we're being technical we are not the ones forcing their hands it's the brokers  We just happen to have what they need when options get assigned but I agree with you they will do absolutely everything to get out of this  They are obviously not going to profit off this deal so the move now is to mitigate the loss as much as possible  Also it's starting to seem more and more likely that the hedgies will not be able to cover on their own  This means either they get funds from another HF the pass the bag to the brokers and I think even the brokers won't want to touch it and if it gets to the DTCC they HAVE to and they have insurance that goes over that situation so the money will come eventually it's just a question of when I personally don't think anytime soon  This war will ensue for a few months ,2021-03-16 00:37:14.087485

Lol  The fact that they're covered calls is better for him than them being naked calls and has very little to do with how fucked he could be though with Gamestop's current downward momentum his calls could land OTM   The point is he's fucked out of his shares if Gamestop doesn't drop to below his strike price    Because then he basically took out a loan to get those shares  If those shares sell below his loan amount he's getting fucked out of money and has to put more money in to make up the difference of his loan    It doesn't matter if he sold covered calls naked calls or poor man's covered calls  He needs gamestop to close below his strike prices on Friday to not lose loan money ,2021-03-16 00:37:37.135640

Don't think you have it right   In your example it would be more like:  100 shares of stock A have been issued by the company  10 shares are held by the board and other company insiders and thus have some restrictions on when they are sold  Thus there are 90 shares on the open market that can be bought and sold by institutional and/or retail investors   In other words institutional investors are part of the float   All of this highlights how manipulated GME stock is: institutions are stating to the SEC that they owned as of 12/30/2020 97 million shares when less than 70 million shares have been issued by the company ,2021-03-16 00:37:45.059683

I agree - what happened on round 1 was the short squeeze   I don’t think there are as many shorts as there were back in January    2nd round was/is some sort of a gamma squeeze and a whale play   Could be whales bought in ramped it to 348 unload then bought puts to ride the way down  Low float low volume can move a stock like that      I still think there should be some run up since earnings are next wk but premiums might have been too prohibitive Friday and today   With underlying price getting wrecked might be ripe for retail to participate since premiums went down a lot     Until Friday/today the charts looked really bullish on almost all time frames   Good thing is today it wanted to touch the 9day ma but it did not ,2021-03-16 00:38:58.335542

I know people will pile on because this place gets culty as fuck but it is concerning that we're dipping while AMC  is rising    We need the volume to keep this train going and AMC is serving as a distraction especially to the stimmy crowd  Volume that probably would've gone our way previously   More discounts are great but we still need to hope this price doesn't go so low that the HF can buy out of their shorts too easily   We need a volume surge tomorrow ,2021-03-16 00:41:27.600154

New systems were released this holiday season expensive ones and they sold out   Usually these systems are purchased with games accessories memberships   It's in the original DD GME has much better earnings after new system release   On top of that the flip to e-commerce not too mention all this great marketing will have earnings looking good for a while even if we don't pop   My problem is with your title and your assumption that a gamma squeeze is needed   All these options could very well end up out of money and be a waste of resources   The float is long gone and time will see it shown   All one needs is tickets for the ride cause it's gonna go regardless it doesn't need to end this week ,2021-03-16 00:42:26.586994

The point is to discuss the plays and the analysis       You can live in the fantasy conspiracy world where brokerages are out to get you but if you're ignoring counterpoints and just want to believe your thing despite all common sense to the contrary you can       You made a few points I gave alternate explanations for those things  Short positions buy calls to hedge       If you don't wish to believe that you don't have to but it's a reality ,2021-03-16 00:42:26.587168
Referring to the statements made by various sources in the financial community back during the tail end of the first run up  Always questioned them but I know I don’t know a lot so while I distrust them I know that they know more than I do  I agree it seems unlikely but the numbers being published fight to say they did  Who knows    They’re unimportant if an external factor was to propel us back into the 300s such as a good earnings combined with positive volume or a big whale moving things our way  Problem is we don’t know for certain that any of those things are coming  We don’t know if we’ll get more gamma squeezes  These are all risks as every trade has some,2021-03-16 00:42:26.587251

When they write put orders they eventually have to buy the stock back right?  As long as the number of shares that retail holds increases over time  wouldn't this cause the supply of borrowable shares to decrease thus increasing the interest to borrow shares increase over time?  It seems to me that as more time passes the more favorable position retail investors are in ,2021-03-16 00:43:08.979894

That's because AMC cleared its major bankruptcy threat when it bartered shares for debt back in January  Now it has a straight forward path to walk to get through COVID relatively unscathed  GME on the other hand is still predicated on a completely unknown but optimistic thesis that it can compete with Steam/GoG/PSN/XboxLive etc ,2021-03-16 00:43:17.586856

Eeeeh you'd still need an influx of cash to continue shorting if the debts you've already accrued from shorting were large enough  If i short at $50 and the price goes to $200 my net position is now 4x worse than before and that'll eat into my ability to continue shorting ,2021-03-16 00:45:37.254312
You pay $120 for the 2022 3 5c  You sell a 5 00c expiring this week for $20 premium  If the underlying reaches $5 20 at expiration you will get exercised so you lose your 3 5c which means you buy 100 shares for $350 sell them for $500 and keep the premium  So you profit $170 - $120 the premium you paid for the call  Multiply everything by 5 if you’re doing this on 5 contracts instead of one     But if you don’t end up ITM on the short position you get to sell another weekly on Monday  Best case scenario your break even never gets reached and you keep rolling out and up until you’re ready to take profits on the leaps ,2021-03-16 00:45:37.865831

It isn't  And this is why the whole GME thing is bad business - people misinterpret it as a coordinated pum-and-dump    Traders sharing information on why they think the price will go up is totally different than coordinating a group effort of liquidating and hopping on another stock; aka pump-and-dump ,2021-03-16 00:46:12.540566

Would love this to be the case  If not however I read a great post by u/jn_ku that suggests the annual meeting would be the time for a vote of confidence in RC as CEO so shares being recalled would be part of that voting process  I can wait but an earlier announcement would be very cool  I think they're under gag orders until the ER drops so maybe there's a bomb just waiting to be dropped for our side ,2021-03-16 00:47:38.526213
Ok I'm ready,2021-03-16 00:47:38.526280
All out warfare I think a smaller portfolio capitulated and we were on the verge of 🚀 but a longer player stepped in to assist  If you notice the price attacks also correlated at the same time as Friday's     Bulls were in control bringing the SP down to open and then closing up same as Friday    I'm interested to see if we can gap open above 16 tomorrow   ,2021-03-16 00:47:38.642564

This attitude- which I'm seeing more than just in your post- makes no sense   No one here is going to sell because of anything these guys say  All that might happen is the people who listen to them buy   That's a good thing   Don't be reactionary  You should want as many people buying this week as possible for whatever reason ,2021-03-16 00:50:15.591516

Hasn't it been a buy for like 2 months?,2021-03-16 00:51:17.173922
I disagree this isn't going to go up more because of fundamentals such as company transformation  RC is first going to have to catch up and make it worth what it's sitting at right now in price first  Fundamentally it's probably a $20 company at the moment so gotta catch it up to the $200 price range first   If GME is going to get to $1000 or more it's because of the apes hype and diamond hands ,2021-03-16 00:51:19.183568

Well the one thing I've noticed in the two months I've been trading is that fundamentals don't really matter much anymore  While I still do my due diligence I also look at factors most normal funds would not  It seems to be those intangibles that will send a stock skyrocketing  I mean just look at AMC  Then you look at a company like LI or NIO that should be trading at twice their current value IMHO   That's why so many people on Wall Street are so pissed off  They had equations that they would use that aren't really valid all the time anymore,2021-03-16 00:51:28.121839

Buy backs aren't a good thing for long term investors when they decide to buy back when the stock goes through a large increase in share price   It will certainly help the float  but you have to question management's use of capital when they could've bought back when it was cheap,2021-03-16 00:52:52.124786
The price listed is per share and options contracts are traded in increments of 100 shares  You are never obligated to exercise an option and the extent of your risk is what you paid up front    There's 2 options at expiration time: your strike price is either higher or lower than market rate  If higher there's no reason to exercise and the option expires worthless  If lower then yes technically you have to exercise and buy the stock   even a profitable in the money option can expire worthless  In practice if you wish to see it through to the end you can just sell the option a few minutes before market close  Another party will scoop it up at negligible cost and extract the profit for you ,2021-03-16 00:52:54.145307

I think it is a momentum play  For the very short term you can make money   I was holding AMC bags from the last spike     I ensured I had a stop loss in place once it got over 14 the second time   Second time it dropped to $3 60 in the day it triggered    Lost 4% from my buy in but I’m happy to be out    I hope it goes up for others but with GME falling I’m afraid AMC will drop prematket     I agree the dilution makes it a $2-3 stock   I’d not be stunned if they diluted today at the plummet    If news breaks like that it will kill it     I was $30k in and it was a poor play at the time chasing it    I’d rather have been in GME as that was the real play in theory,2021-03-16 00:53:04.035742

I also believed that but tbf after all of you kept saying that for a month straight you all disappeared when it went from $40 to $340 which kind of begs the question if you know wtf you are talking about or you are just another dude who points at rain and say it's wet   It's easy to say a stock is going down when it's going down but by your logic it shouldn't have reached $340 after it reached $400 in January ,2021-03-16 00:54:57.995891

I'd love for you to try to explain that opinion   By that same logic you should never buy TSLA AMZN AAPL because you can't make any profit off of a company worth more than $100    I'd much rather have 1000% gain on 1 GME than 25% gain on 12 AMC,2021-03-16 00:59:04.112514

Very well where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery  My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet  My father would womanize he would drink he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark  Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament  My childhood was typical summers in Rangoon luge lessons  In the spring we'd make meat helmets  When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds pretty standard really  At the age of 12 I received my first scribe  At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles       There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum it's breathtaking I suggest you try it ,2021-03-16 00:59:30.131917

White flight was usually reactionary  In the case of my small town the black neighborhoods were “company towns ” Little better than sharecropping  Industry built the neighborhood so folk could walk to work then the company took rent out of they paycheck   Fast forward 100 years- whites have retreated to the country where it’s nice and black folk are 3 generations later still living there dying of rare cancers children have rare birth defects and everyone has asthma or asbestosis- never having lived or worked in asbestos    GUH  Trying to fix it is a losing battle  The problem is too big   It’s so fucking painful  I’m hoping after beating my head against this problem for at least another few years I’ll have made a dent in it ,2021-03-16 01:00:07.345740

It's possible I usually avoid placing things to dates  Looking at the hourly or daily we've been sticking inside of an ascending megaphone pattern which is where my upper range of 403 comes from  Bottom limit is around 370 which would also break the trend line from 2018 2019 and 2020's corrections  I feel like we have enough momentum right now to hit 400 to 403 before we move to the downside  I honestly like to only commit to a play when it's obvious where it's going and if I can swing it day trade options to capture a slice of the move ,2021-03-16 01:00:33.615135

Making it cheaper right now is just helping GME shareholders drop more money into it to increase our gains in the future  I don't know what their HF's game plan was but that doesn't seem very smart to me    If they had let us hit a higher crescendo last week GME shares would have likely had a much greater fizzle out this week  Now instead it is a cheaper cost of entry and they have very likely enticed a bunch of new apes this week  These are people who wouldn't have bought in with us previously if price had remained higher  As these newly minted apes hit the scene they will hear from the rest of us who have paper-handed ourselves into regrettable losses and learned from it and they will wise up from our shareholder experience  Then we have more apes with diamond hands added to the ranks of GME shareholders  WINNER WINNER  I could be wrong thoughts?,2021-03-16 01:01:36.878262

Honestly instead of corporate handouts I would rather see our government paying for improvements in water power food and internet in poorer communities  It would create jobs to build up the infrastructure and the funds used to pay for the services would go back to the companies who are providing the services  Better to make them earn than to give out no strings attached handouts to corporations paying CEOs $1 million plus   Ape translation :Money for services from corporations and basic needs met for underprivileged Americans,2021-03-16 01:01:58.130053

Check out what it was trading at last week when $BA was around $250   The main thing Boeing stock lacked was volatility & now it's here   I personally believe these put options are severely underpriced & represent an amazing low cost / high risk / rocket return potential!  They went from 20 cents to 51 cents in roughly twenty minutes during this morning's drop to $264 33   Now consider what would happen if the media actually reported the updated court info I source and analysts stop upgrading!  This might all occur tomorrow   or any of the current issues I point out like victims families obtaining docs soon!,2021-03-16 01:03:09.313073

"It seems like it was ""invented"" multiple times throughout time  Ancient Mesopotamians In \~2000BC Sumarian scribes used blank spaces to denote absences in number columns  The first recorded 0-like symbols is seen in third centaury BC in ancient Babylon as they used a base 60 number system  A similar symbols popped up in 350 AD when the Mayans marked calendars  Originally these symbols were used as placeholders not it's own number  It was only in 7th centaury AD in India where it gained it's importance as a value  By the 9th centaury AD 0 was adopted into the Arabic numeral system in the shape we see now   So yes and no   Fun Fact: 0 as a symbol only entered Europe in the 12th Centaury AD",2021-03-16 01:04:01.180918

Use it at a savings account with bullshit gambling money   I logged into Gemini this year a $1500 I put in a few years back is 13000 now    If you’re gonna pizza away on options throw in a few hundred bucks here and there it will fluctuate but never die    people been saying it’s going to crash to zero since day 1,2021-03-16 01:06:15.586931
What made you gather whales getting out that were long?? we know that the volume was low when we dipped hard  they borrowed 500k shares and 5 min later they short laddered it! you could see it plan as day by looking at the volume 500k volume on a 5 min  no one sold! either do some dd or stop being a shill,2021-03-16 01:06:15.586998

If today's downward movement was from paper handed retards it would've been more gradual  If it was a whale trying to unwind their GME position they'd want to do it in smaller chunks in order to make as big a profit as possible  A massive amount of selling without regard for the price definitely looks more like a short attack trying to shake out paper hands than anything else   Look back at today's chart  From open to about 11:04am GME traded sideways and by 11:18am it had dropped from appx  $270 to $226 in 14 MINUTES  As volatile as GME is that seems like a pretty clear and concerted effort to push the price down hard and fast and only people that want that are shortie bitches ,2021-03-16 01:07:08.107582

Me personally   I’d sell one exercise one hold the last one  Either way you’re taking profit loading a position and averaging down and by saving the last one you’re still holding your seat at the table  However that’s still contingent on how much you paid for them and what your break even is  You do you but shares is what’s going to pay off more in the long term for GME,2021-03-16 01:08:25.922656

Tanning is a fortunate side affect of this wonder drug but the regulators would never have given approval for a tanning drug  So the company had to choose a proof of concept indication EPP a rare disease where patients are in pain from being in the sun  This arguably gave it the best chance of being accepted by the regulators as there was no other effective alternative treatment  But there’s so much more to this drug than meets the eye  Regarding tanning they will be releasing topicals which contains fragments of the active peptide  This will be available over the counter and will be priced under $100 a bottle easily  These will induce tanning or photoprotection which helps fight the war against melanoma and other skin cancers  The peptide is also known to repair DNA by extension this will largely prevent skin cancer from developing  This is a huge market especially where anti-aging is concerned so the dermocosmetic market will be a target and is currently valued at approx  $15-25 billion annual and rising  But this is only one small aspect of what the company can achieve  The medical applications for this drug are profound  with one example being a trial is set to begin in stroke patients to help improve recovery in the penumbra site of the insult in the brain  Further there is speculation about a 6th indication being neurotrophic-oriented which could be multiple sclerosis or dementia  Either one of these indications if approved will make the company a $100 stock  This is baked up by the addressable markets Clinuvel has spoken about in their recent Strategic Update document available on their website  There is a Clinuvel forum called Sharetease that has lots of research and information  The sad thing about people’s initial reaction is they don’t realise what this company will achieve long term they only think of the tan  But actually this peptide is essentially a miracle drug which acts an immune modulator repairs DNA strengthens the vascular system etc  In recent studies the peptide was shown to reduce amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s while another study showed rats with induced cardiac arrest had a 70% increase in survivability when administer the peptide  The world dosent understand this drug yet but it has the potential to become one of the most well known drugs  Also because it’s a analogue copy of a naturally occuring peptide in the body it doesn’t have side affects like with steroids and other similar drugs ,2021-03-16 01:09:28.969291

GME was on here long before you jumped on    And I didn't think it was impossible at all  I was making rips off the volatility  Unfortunately I got a series of stuff going on in my real life that I didn't pop out of one of my rips so I could sell when it got high  I even told my friend I was buying more at 45 an hour beforehand  I did sell some when it went up over 200 but unfortunately I can't on the rest   And guesstimate what when this crashes again I will buy more and still do rips because it will spike again because of folks like you  Except the peak will be lower again  I'll liquidate on that one and buy in at bottom again but probably nominal shares at that point and let them sit  I think a third pump and dump will happen before the morons catch on or run out of money ,2021-03-16 01:12:43.660060

Look into APHA-TLRY merger  If you buy apha now you get a discount  You can either sell it before the merger if you like the gains or you can let it ride long after the merger  Tilray will be the largest weed company in the world  If you're scared throw in only a bit and see how you feel about it  Good move to get back in as the only real thing that could fuck with this is if the merge doesn't happen which has a very very slim chance of happening,2021-03-16 01:12:55.167078

This is a good point  In order to help fuel the spikes you'll need to be actively watching and submit buy orders when you see volume spiking  It's also worth pointing out that the shorts can run the price up intentionally to set a trap before attacking it to cause a panic sale  They've done this several times already ,2021-03-16 01:13:28.146526

"Good job getting indignant for no reason whatsoever   Or were you trying to say that you think non-English speakers aren't capable of using a spellcheker?   Because that's the only way your attitude makes any sense    The majority of people who speak English as a second language are better at spelling than native speakers because they actually try and more often use their spellchecker when they're not sure of something    I literally just said ""*That being said spellcheckers don't correct misused idioms so I think it's still worth making such corrections gently since they're a learning opportunity  People can't help not knowing something if they're never informed *""  So since they have access to the same technology as the rest of us and given that I just told you it's better to gently inform people of errors that a spellchecker doesn't catch could you please try to explain exactly what part of any of this is prejudiced against people who speak English as a second language?

I bought into GME shortly before the RH freeze  I didn’t get the worst of it but I did end up down something like 60-70% idk I stopped watching  Bought some more on the way back up to lower my average   Still green after today’s shenanigans   What I’m really saying is you should have doubled down on the dip  I bought in on AMC at 14 50 and lowered my average to 11 50 last week   The real question you have to ask yourself now is: “how much can I afford to lose?”  You want to go for a ride? Cause there’s a good chance you can sell for a decent % profit  I can’t guarantee that this is called betting for a reason   Me I’m holding long  If there’s a rocket or even a rocket test to the stratosphere I want to be on it   I’m also holding a personal belief that stock is worth more or rather WILL BE once restrictions lift especially with the new deals they’ve signed that helps make them more competitive to streaming which people are totally over after lockup for over a year   I believe the repressed socialization aspect of theater going is leading to a huge boom in the theater business so to me it seems like it will have greater value in a few months regardless of other market movements going on right now,2021-03-16 01:15:45.791294

If there are multiple days of 1-3 millions shares fail to deliver if last time is any indication should be several days of modest gains followed by giant leap  I would assume any day like today is one where there will be significant FTD 1-3 million  I would imagine they will try and push the reckoning past this Friday as so many on this sub have staked a lot on it if they do next week is going to be bonkers  And we get to check price movement against FTD to prove our thesis and buy more as they push price down  This is easy money ,2021-03-16 01:16:27.971744

It's hard to say how likely the squeeze actually is because it depends on short interest which is never going to be publicly reported accurately on this stock  I personally feel like the short interest is still much higher than reported and a squeeze will happen   There are catalysts that could cause volume which I feel is what we have to wait for  Because people are no longer buying many shares something needs to excite people so they will  Friday is going to be a weird day because of the quadruple witching day and the 23rd is earnings  Best case scenario is we get an announcement of some sort during the earings call ,2021-03-16 01:16:50.568766

As far as I can tell you can't really lose anymore money than you initially put into it though right?  I mean your call is either going to be worthless or worth very little or worth a lot or something in between   But I don't know how you can lose enormous cash this way     I'm a retard though so maybe there's something I'm missing   There was a guy last week who said something about selling a call contract  which meant he either owed the person he sold it to 100 shares or 25000 dollars    but that seems like something besides just buying a call option ,2021-03-16 01:18:34.987134

It's highly unlikely that the strike price of $510 would be met the next week when that option contract expires   I mean just today GME had to be halted due to massive sell-offs Today's bell opened at around $270 and closed at around $220   Good luck for him to reach the target of $510 next week I just don't see it happening   It was a great play for him as a rich man's lottery ticket I mean it isn't technically impossible for the price to reach $510 and getting that option contract ITM before it expires   I am sure the price could eventually reach $510 but I don't think it's going to happen next week ,2021-03-16 01:19:30.343922

"I dunno my feelings on name changes is kinda mixed    Only examples I can come up with is the world of music    When an established band changes their name after several years ""in the business"" so to speak there's a lot of misinformation about the new band  Some people who don't do a bit of research just lump them in with ""another new band "" Still merchandising and branding is always tough on name changes which is why short of a completely different style and sound renaming shouldn't be done       Personally I thought Metallica should have changed band names after the Black album due to not only a drastic style and sound change but a seeming unwillingness to write music for over 20 years that would be even remotely considered ""metal "" My opinion only    Don't get mad!      In BlackBerry's case it might be intriguing to some to see what this company USED to do versus what it does now  The core of BlackBerry is somewhat the same; the phone market USED to be a huge part of what they did but it wasn't ALWAYS their only function    Just like G E  doesn't ""just make lightbulbs and washing machines"" my own early idiotic ideology about what G E  was all about ""back in the day"" many companies realize that having all your eggs in one basket generally tends to see drastic losses on the worst of days        But it depends on the industry    Fuck I'm philosophizing again   ",2021-03-16 01:20:07.314076

Margin just means that they'll let you borrow money  In this case they'll loan you the cash for your purchase if the cash from your sale didn't come in yet     More generally it let's you make riskier trades without holding cash to insure them like non-coveted options trading as long as you have enough assets in your account to use as collateral     It's a really good way to lose money quickly ,2021-03-16 01:20:34.164716

Hey I work in the gaming industry and I just don't see gamestop surviving long term       Converting to a streaming/online model is expensive and time consuming and even there the margins aren't great  Paying for CDN bandwidth and storage isn't cheap  Maintaining a steam like launcher isnt easy       Most AAA game shops aren't going to give up 10% to a streaming gamestop we're going to make our own launchers      They may very well eek some workable model and hold on for a few more years but there's no evidence they're worth the 14 billion valuation the stock currently sits at       Just because a bunch of retail folks pumped up a stock to a ridiculous price doesn't change the reality of the retail marker or what places like amazon have done to them    What the hedge funds did to try to short them out of business was a dick move Im not for anything like that  But at the same time this stock price isn't sustainable unless every retail trader never sells and then what exactly where did that get you ,2021-03-16 01:22:07.045032

I know you guys are all excited to shit on Citadel and all  But most likely what they’re doing is loading up on cheap money now before bond prices spike    My guess is that they think that bond markets are going to spike in reaction to the massive amount of money printing we’ve been doing  It makes A TON of sense to grab cheap fixed rate money now if inflation is going to explode    This is the same reason it’s great to own a fixed rate mortgage during periods of high inflation    In the 70s the fed funds rate hit something ridiculous like 15%  If this happens again they stand to make a ton of fucking money  And if not? The percentage rate on the bond is so low it’s a pretty minimal risk ,2021-03-16 01:22:40.193787

Online retail Price to Sales avg is 4 5  GME sits at 3 0  This thing should be much higher based off the fundamental/comparables case alone,2021-03-16 01:22:43.281525
I didn’t get into the hype of GME and have sadly missed out but I’m really happy to see a sub of smooth brains come together for an actual cause that will make a massive difference trading tendies for gorillas  Love this place 😅,2021-03-16 01:22:44.369460

If an entity would give you money at an interest rate you believed you could grow faster than why wouldn’t you?  I don’t think this is any sign they’re underwater ,2021-03-16 01:22:48.935262
For example if you buy 10 shares at $250/share you spend $2500 for 10 shares  The next day if the price of those shares increases to $300/share you still have 10 shares it’s just that they’re worth more  The average daily volume over the last 2 weeks is 48 million / day so it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to make an impact on the liquidity of that stock unless you have massive amounts of money   Does day trading and ending the day with the same number of shares count as “holding”? In your own perspective you’ll just have to pay short term tax rates on your gains  If you hold for more than 1 year you’re taxed less  By trading away and rebuying several times a day as you see the price curve go up and down you are not effectively holding for tax purposes ,2021-03-16 01:22:48.935358

This is turning on my bullshit meter  If you work for a investment bank/hedge fund etc you are not allowed to take your own personal trades due to a conflict of interest  Excluding index funds and ETFs  There is no way the traders or any employees would be allowed to trade GME   Similarly the relative of a person working there must make a disclosure to their broker that they have a family member working on trades    I'm long as fuck on GME but this is utter bullshit,2021-03-16 01:25:17.366131

That's correct if you spend $500 on a call option the most you can lose is $500  The problem is a lot of people will only have $500 to their name and will bet it all on a call option then hold too long and then wonder why their account is showing a balance of $0 when time decay completely destroyed the value of their 800 00 strike GME options that expire tomorrow    : At least with owning shares you won't lose 100% of your investment unless the company literally goes out of business which is possible but much less likely ,2021-03-16 01:26:24.524077

It's a simple conclusion  They currently operate in a state with 1 1 dispensaries per 100k people while legal states are over 10 per 100k  In addition to more competition for customers they will face competition *within their store* for the first time    Currently they ONLY sell Trulieve products  What happens when vertical integration is removed and stores are free and encouraged to carry an array of brands? They could realistically lose over 50% of the shelf space within their own stores and that percentage is across all 70+ locations    There's also no reason to expect them to be welcomed with open arms into a legal market by the retail stores they will depend on to help move their 1 **million** sqft of grow space  It's easy to do when you own the majority of stores and sell your product exclusively  It's a lot harder to do in an open market ,2021-03-16 01:26:38.086920

Better for the lender maybe  Bonds are sold in this case by businesses to raise money  But there has to be an incentive for people to buy them  The incentive is the interest paid on the principal or the yield expressed as a percent  Bonds can be resold and the up-front price of the bond can be adjusted to mess with the effective interest rate  Because $4 a year on a $98 bond is a better yield than the same $4 with a $100 ticket price instead  And when the bonds mature or expire you get the original first-sale ticket price back if you're the last one holding the bond and the bond seller didn't go bankrupt    So it's just a little silly that a shittier rating less likely to be paid; increased risk of bankruptcy bond is being sold with a worse yield than other bonds already on the market ,2021-03-16 01:28:21.434532

I'm by no means an expert so someone correct me if I'm wrong but I believe they have 21 days after shorting to make the cover  They're shorting millions more every week so it's almost inconceivable that they cover their positions because of day traders and paperhands but they're literally just praying that the hype dies down the stock value goes down and they can cover at a cheaper price  They are hemorrhaging money at a huge rate currently but they stand to lose much more if we just hold and wait for their timers to run out ,2021-03-16 01:28:58.228812

Buying calls/puts can can only lose what you put it  The difference being that you are very likely  around 75percent to lose it all  With shares in general they may tank but you aren't going to lose anywhere close to all of it  With options if the stock turns against you it's basically gone very quickly and if close to expiration there is basically no chance of recovery unless a massive move by the stock  Conversely if you buy them and then the stock rips you could quickly find yourself up 4-500 percent and even more  Because each contract represents 100 shares so it's highly leveraged   It's alot more complicated than that but you get the idea  If you buy an option just be ready to lose it all cause that's the most likely outcome ,2021-03-16 01:29:18.002174
BB is a good company on paper with a lot of potential  Their EV software has huge potential  But sadly BB got tied heavily into the meme stocks and it messed it up  The price was inflated for quite a while and bounced a lot because of it  It also continues to bounce  I thing it’s not a $11 stock yet but can get there and beyond  I would wait for dips as tech stocks drop they will and try to get shares at under $10  Anything in the $9 range feels too low for BB right now but it will get there again when people move out of tech as they panic over the market ,2021-03-16 01:29:20.510622

No one could've saw that hard dip and the halt on buying coming  The the amount of failing to deliver everyday for twelve consecutive days and reseting on the 13th day to avoid being forced to cover completely its honestly a completely liable play to keep holding   With the second some up of the stock and more people piling on everyday the squeeze looks like it'll happen more and more  The whole point of holding is to not give them a single stock to cover before it gets to a crazy number    Also of course I'm retarded have you not seen the sub we're on my man???

I’m sure that would be a good play as well but I believe Altria will do more than just sit on their Cronos investment especially with how lack luster Canadian Weed Cos have been in the US  Think they take the route of buying smaller established brands to have a huge variety similar to what they have with cigarettes currently  Not sure who here is into weed but if they bought into/just bought any big names like Russian Assassin Boys Runtz Cookies etc they fly  Personally I’d like to see them take a stake in CURLF over any others ,2021-03-16 01:30:50.724508

Publicity helps us find lost apes even if it's random meme based publicity it helps  Think how much Citadel and friends have been spending on buying the media  $300k on charity paints us in a better light doesn't it?

In December GME had 100%+ short interest AMC has 20% they can literally cover in less than a day it's not a short squeeze it's a short pump  It's a great short term play by any metric just riding the hype is an easy 50% gain if you got in below $10 but when you compare it's potential to GME you see it's not the same or anywhere close ,2021-03-16 01:34:43.937586

"I got out two thirds during premarket because it was money I can't afford to lose  Now I wish I had exited completely Cramer is the worst omen      The hedgies didn't get me down  The news didn't get me down  But seeing people yolo tens to hundreds of thousands on useless far-OTM 0DTE calls last week sure did  Wednesday a whale bought a mountain of $200 puts  Then a short ladder and simultaneously the MMs assisted the crazy drop automatically because delta recalc those puts meant they needed less shares held to hedge to neutral  All we needed was people to buy $200 calls to cancel those out and end the week at $340  And it didn't happen  Forbes even said as much and ironically I think *that* was the reverse psychology play      I'm holding on to hope with my remaining 10 shares but unless the PRC / Max Pain gets rebalanced I'm bailing out 9 of them at my cost basis if we see further decline  Retail doesn't have the coordination or capital to create momentum at these price levels  And hedge funds are psychos who don't feel emotion so time is on their side  If it moons to infinite I'll settle for just one ticket  If it consolidates at 40 or 100 again I'll buy back in with a lot more knowledge on how to leverage the MMs against the hedgies   We'd need to basically be a crowd sourced hedgefund to play at their level and win but that's illegal as ""market manipulation "" Since we can't do that our only hope is a whale to match all the unbalanced puts with calls and then to make up some upwards volume frontrunning the MMs being forced to rehedge buying shares  Fuck man I don't want a lambo  I just want an implant dentist  ![gif]emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_bad_man",2021-03-16 01:35:18.637812

"Yep! An Oct 18 expiration with a 30 00 strike on a stock that's currently $15/share would gain a ton of value if the stock shot up to $22 a month from today  Of course it depends on the stock too if it was a stock that only moves up pennies a day you won't make a lot but a more volatile stock like AMC or GME would make much more because of what's called ""implied volatility "" The higher the IV the more expensive the calls and the more profit you can make from them  But yeah you could sell the call a month later in your example and make a huge return if the stock was volatile enough like AMC for example  *not financial advice of course*",2021-03-16 01:37:51.502507

So for question 1 yes 92B is a high market cap and gaining 50% in a year putting them at 138B is a large increase but if you account for shifting P/Es due to growth it makes it very doable  It’s not just the legalization itself they need to take action to grow    This directly ties into why I believe this is a better investment than CRON  I believe Altria will do more than just sit on their Cronos investment especially with how lack luster Canadian Weed Cos have been in the US  Think they take the route of buying smaller established brands to have a huge variety similar to what they have with cigarettes currently  Not sure who here is into weed but if they bought into/just bought any big names like Russian Assassin Boys Runtz Cookies etc they fly  Personally I’d like to see them take a stake in CURLF over any others ,2021-03-16 01:38:00.735538

I don’t really get this comment  How do you know how much other money this person has saved? How do you he’s retiring? How do you know he’s not already negotiating with other companies? How do you know he’s not trying to switch careers because his last one made him miserable and he finally has some runway to do it?

Your brokerage account on Robinhood or Webull or whatever you use is still a financial account in your name  So when you sell a stock and the funds enter your brokerage account the profit you made off the sale is considered capital gains and the loss you suffered is considered a loss that is tax deductible  The computer does all the calculations for you and in February of 2022 it will release a Form 1099B which will tell you everything you need to know for filing your 2021 taxes with respects to accounting for your stock trading   For your question about helping a HF buy GME stock well if an HF attempts to buy a share of GME and you sell a share of GME they might be the purchaser of your share so yes  But I don’t think Hedge funds are buying any shares of GME right now  The stock price is above $200 and an HF is assuming that it’s way overvalued  An HF would determine that the real value of that stock is closer to $20/share based on pre-spike values and inflation  Hedge funds look for cream of the crop low risk investments and GME is just super volatile right now so I don’t think GME is anywhere on their radar at the moment  If you’re going to invest your money don’t adjust your behavior on anything about hedge funds; rather invest in a company you understand and believe in  For example the company you work for  You know the company pretty well if you work there every day maybe you know when’s a good time to buy/sell and a basis for those decisions ,2021-03-16 01:43:30.945154
It's alright I'm new to this and in over my head too just been reading a lot  But yes it could be either of those things but I would assume out of my ass that the amount of volume circulating through the hedge funds as they cover and short more is greater than what retail is buying on average  Idrk,2021-03-16 01:43:30.945341

"If GME had hit $380 before the expiration date of 3/12 he would have the right to purchase 100 shares of GME at the price of $380 per share but not the obligation to buy them   In that case he would have the choice to ""exercise"" his contract   Exercising in this case means having the right to buy those shares at his strike price of $380   In order to be able to exercise the contract he would need $380 \* 100 shares = $38000 in order to be able to buy them   If he cannot afford to exercise meaning that he doesn't have enough money in order to purchase 100 shares at that face value then he can sell that options contract his rights to purchase these shares at $380 each time 100 shares in the open market   Note:  Each option contract is always for 100 shares   So when you buy 1 options contract you are indeed purchasing the right to buy 100 shares at your desired strike price   You will only have the rights to purchase these shares at your desires strike price IF your contract reaches its strike price BEFORE your chosen expiration date   IF that does not happen then the contract expires worthless you lose the amount of money you used in order to purchase the options contract ",2021-03-16 01:43:46.953626

It’s pretty obvious the hedges are trying to get the weaklings to paper hand  Look at the volume traded that drove the price down  No way that’s retail  If retail buys up as many available shares as they can at every opportunity especially tax returns and stimmies their short sells are going to be even more difficult to cover and they’ll go belly up tripling down on the same tires bet they’ve been hedging against GME for months now   You like the stock?

As much as I love the story I would like to point out that debt is normal course business for all corporations including financials and is often required by regulatory institutions  S&P even points out low leverage as a strength for them  $600MM is not a large debt sale for a financial and I am willing to bet my entire GME position that this financing has nothing to do with GME ,2021-03-16 01:45:44.946280

Ah so that's why the 19th has been hyped so much  Thank you very much for taking the time to respond to my original comment and provide answers  So does that mean hypothetically we may see a big squeeze on Friday? Or will that come into effect close of play on Friday meaning Monday would be the real date we'd care about? Also where does the money come from if it lands on Brokerages? I know 500k per share is a mean but hypothetically there has to be a max price that can be set for the stock as money is finite right?,2021-03-16 01:46:27.936105

Yes I created this account 41 days ago  I created this account the day Mark Cuban chatted with us 🦍  When I invested in gme in January it was out of fomo  I saw the price drop and my portfolio turn red for the first time in my life  I was panicking and didn’t understand what was going on But I held  I learned a lot from the Mark Cuban chat and I continued to follow wsb afterwards  I’ve learned everyday and continue to learn everyday about the current situation of GME stocks options shorts etc    I know firsthand how it is easy to panic when you see stock dip and I understand how a lot of new traders can have the same reaction  I’m trying to help other apes understand and educate them the best of my ability because the ONLY WAY WE GO TO THE MOON is if APES STRONG TOGETHER!   So while you continue to criticize all the newbies that joined Reddit and wsb I’ll continue to try to help my fellow apes as much as I can ,2021-03-16 01:49:01.374044

Sir  I was being nice  Now I’ll just come out and say you are a fucking idiot    I saw you replied “no these holdings are from February ” No fucktard  The filing is as of 12/31 and published 45 days later February  I saw you said “they” had to issue a convertible bond    Dude you don’t know what you’re fucking talking about  Citadel issued a bond which they have done in the past and people accepted a 3 75% interest rate for the risk of credit on Citadel’s hedge fund for 5 years    so yeah the market doesn’t think they’re blowing up anytime soon    And yes “that’s how the prices of stock absolutely change in value”  Now run along put their stock positions in an Excel file and calculate the total returns weighted by holdings for their long positions    I’d feel bad for your brain if you had one ,2021-03-16 01:49:04.370610

I cleared out of AMC today after reversing my trend from down 80% to up 20%   I sunk all into GME   Now sitting at 300 shares at $141 after starting GME at $343 with 30 shares   I have worked very hard to get this right   Now I rest and wait     My exit strategy is sell 50 shares at $800 to clear my investment and then  💎 ✋  through supernova 250 shares   If it goes crazy to $10000/share I will sell 150 shares and keep the other 100 shares through the split which will DEFINITELY happen if it gets that high     I am guessing 10-1 so that GME can raise money for the conversion and become the Amazon of tech and gaming   This is just me     no financial advice   Also I personally like peanut butter on my banana and am fascinated by my wife's boyfriend's girlfriend and kneel before her for wet golden love ,2021-03-16 01:53:32.847797

Anyone else feel like all the talk of 100k+ shares is counterproductive and pushing people out not drawing them in? I remember when people were excited about 1k as a possibility which IMO is possible and maybe even likely  Now we have expectations which are IMO insane people buying far OTM calls 1 week out and basically donating to “the enemy” etc  rather than focusing on holding shares and buying ITM/OTM calls   Worse there are probably many people who would buy in but they see crazy speculation like 100k+ shares and think “wow this is beyond retarded therefore the whole play is retarded ” If they saw people with managed expectations they might have more confidence  I get it the math says infinite gains are possible  Cool but I think at even 5-10% of that price the government and/or oligarchy will do whatever crazy asshole move is necessary to kill it  Maybe even declare everything we have done illegal and try to claw back money  Let’s focus and get GME to 300 500 1000 and then I’m happy to talk huge prices,2021-03-16 01:54:50.154405

Only scenario without a conspiracy that plays out IMO is they have AMC on the back burner for now  AMC had great volume today and GME volume was shit  Giant sell off on GME at 11:30am EST around that time and I think that triggered some AMC panic selling due to the past where they both tanked simultaneously ,2021-03-16 01:55:13.069039
